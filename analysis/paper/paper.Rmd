# Introduction

Global biodiversity is being lost at an unprecedented rate as a result of human activities. One of the major world-wide threats to biodiversity is increasing infrastructural development (Benítez-López et al., 2010). Land transformation has resulted in the loss and fragmentation of habitats in many different ecosystem types worldwide (Benítez-López et al., 2010; Sanderson et al., 2002). Roads and other linear infrastructure, in particular, are key components of landscapes as they have become a major cause of habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation and are ubiquitous in most landscapes around the world (van der Ree et al., 2011). Although linear infrastructure is important for society because it provides connectivity for people, it also exerts significant negative effects on adjacent habitats, wildlife populations, communities, and ecosystems (van der Ree et al., 2011).

Resource extraction, such as forest harvesting, is the main driver of road construction in much of Canada's forested area. In British Columbia, over 600 000 kilometers of resource roads make up the vast majority of the province's total road network (83%) (Environmental Reporting BC, 2018; Forest Practices Board, 2015). Over 75% of resource roads in the province were built by the forest industry (Forest Practices Board, 2015). Resource extraction activities provide jobs and renewable raw materials (Canada, 2013b), but they also can create threats for wildlife. For example, the main threats to woodland caribou, a species at risk in Canada, are human disturbances such as forest harvesting, oil and gas exploration/extraction, and road networks. These particular disturbances fragment their habitat, and create open areas and extensive young forests that attract other species such as moose and deer which in turn, attracts an increased number of predators, such as wolves and even poachers (Canada, 2013a). Woodland caribou are often considered to be an umbrella species, which means that protecting and restoring their habitat would benefit other species also dependent on old forests, such as fishers, pine martens, and many species of birds (Mulvihill, 2018).

With certain wildlife, such as woodland caribou, being highly sensitive to road development and use, there is a need to spatially simulate future roads in order to test the implications of alternative recovery policies and resource development scenarios. Landscape models are mathematical simulations designed to represent at least one landscape pattern-process relationship of interest. Landscape models can be great ways to make predictions about specific scenarios that allow ecologists and land managers to assess alternative management scenarios or to assess the potential impact of anthropogenic change scenarios (climate or land use change) (McGarigal, n.d.). Simulating the effects of disturbances, such as forestry road development, helps to broaden the scope of models, especially for species with complex ecological requirements who reside in disturbance-prone landscapes that undergo dynamic changes which may substantially alter habitat quality (Whitman et al., 2017). Land managers are often responsible for multiple species and populations distributed over large regions and often rely on models to determine habitat suitability (Whitman et al., 2017).

Forest simulation models generally either fall into two categories: deterministic and stochastic (Boychuk et al., 2009; Helmes & Stockbridge, 2011). Stochastic simulation approaches use probability distributions in combination with random number generators to determine events (He & Mladenoff, 1999). Despite the importance of roads on the environment, previous spatial stochastic harvest simulation models rarely include forest road network development in their projections. The "roads" package in R aims to fill this gap in landscape modelling by projecting large-scale forest road networks based on future harvest cut blocks, an existing road network, and a road cost surface. This paper uses the "roads" package to run forestry road network simulations in British Columbia from approximately 1990 to present and compares the results to the observed modern-day forest road networks in order to assess the performance of the package and to showcase its usefulness within forest simulations.

(Introduction round 2: road context) Several papers have previously introduced forest road network projections (Anderson & Nelson, 2004; Clark et al., 2000; Dean, 1997) however many of these methods are complex with many input parameters and are not readily available for public use. These previous projections have mainly been developed in order to facilitate operational forest road network planning and therefore require precise data and many input parameters in order to obtain the most effective network. These projection methods are therefore not very applicable for projecting forest roads over large-scale landscapes. On the other hand, many spatial stochastic forest management simulations haven't included forest road development at all (citations). One unpublished QGIS plugin by Clement (2021) is available for projecting forest roads and is also included in the analysis of this paper (GitHub - Klemet/ForestRoadNetworkPluginForQGIS: A plugin for QGIS that is able to construct a forest road network based on a cost matrix, polygons to reach, a current road network, the dijkstra algorithm and 3 network-creation heuristics.). There is therefore a need in large scale landscape simulations for a tool that can adequately project forest road development with less complexity and minimal input parameters that can easily be incorporated into other complex simulations in large scale landscapes. As many ecological forecasts use increasingly complex methods and data, forecasting tools (e.g., models) should also be scalable and leverage existing models (Bodner et al., in press) ("Bridging the divide between ecological forecasts and environmental decision-making").

The goal of our model is to provide simple, accessible, and usable forest road network projections that can easily be applied in the context of large-scale landscapes and wildlife impact simulations, and can also be applied as an element of more complex models. Our model will be openly accessible and uses minimal input parameters (an existing road network, harvest cutblocks, and cost surface) which makes it easily transferable to many forest resource dominated landscapes. Here, we evaluate its accuracy at simulating forest road development across a large landscape by recreating the network starting from approximately 1990 and comparing it to the present day observed forest road network. In order to compare the projected and observed road networks, we used various metrics that are similar to those used in wildlife impact studies to compare the projected and observed landscapes both spatially and aspatially.

In the first section of the paper (methods), we introduce the study area used to assess the accuracy of the projection, we describe the forest road projection methods, the data required, and the various metrics used in order to analyze the similarities and differences between the projected and observed forest road networks across the landscape. Next, we present and discuss the results of our projections across the landscape and compare the metrics spatially and aspatially.

# Methods

## Study Area

We chose the Revelstoke timber supply area (TSA 27), in British Columbia, Canada as our study area because forestry is the dominant resource extraction activity in this region and much of the TSA's road network is composed of forestry resource roads built to gain access to forest harvest cutblocks (Figure 1). This allows us to project road building based on forest harvest data. With approximately 55% of Revelstoke TSA's area being non-forested land (alpine, lakes, swamp, brush, rock, etc) [@brown2010], the TSA also provides an ideal location to observe the behaviour of the projections across a landscape which presents multiple barriers to road development. The Revelstoke TSA is in the interior-wet belt of the province and its forests are dominated by Englemann spruce (31%), Hemlock (23%), Cedar (22%), and Douglas-fir (18%) [@ministryofforests]. The TSA contains wildlife species that are at risk due to their declining populations and are thought to be negatively affected by road development, such as members of the southern mountain woodland caribou population [@brown2010]. The Revelstoke TSA is an example of a landscape where road projections could be used to manage critical wildlife habitats. The British Columbia TSA boundary shapefile layer was downloaded from the British Columbia Data Catalogue [@governmentofbritishcolumbia2021].

## Data

To spatially define the cost of constructing and traveling on a forestry road we developed a cost raster. We used several spatial raster layers to construct our cost surface. Following the Interior Appraisal Manual of BC, the base the cost per kilometer of road was a linear function of slope [@governmentofbritishcolumbia2021a]. Separate costs for river and pipeline crossings were then added and major water bodies were considered barriers and assigned a very high cost. Lastly, existing roads were assigned a cost of 0 (Table 1). The cost raster produced consists of 1703936 pixels with a resolution of 100 meters by 100 meters.

```

Our road network data was obtained by combining the digital road atlas (DRA) [@databc2021] and forest tenure road [@britishcolumbiaministryofforestslandsnaturalresourceoperationsandruraldevelopmentflnrord2021] data sets for BC. To avoid situations where the same road was included in both data sets with slightly different coordinates, we removed all roads from the DRA data set that were within 50m of a road in the forest tenure road data set. The existing road network, used as the starting point for projections, was created by filtering out forest tenure roads with an award date greater than 1990, all roads from the DRA data set were assumed to be built before 1990. Cutblock information was obtained from the Harvest Areas of BC (Consolidated Cutblocks) dataset [@governmentofbritishcolumbia2021b]. Cutblock information is compiled from provincial Forest Cover, the RESULTS Reporting system, Forest Tenure applications, and satellite imagery using change detection processes. The dataset does not exclude non-harvested 'reserved' areas, and satellite image change detection may not always represent the entire cutblock area [@governmentofbritishcolumbia2021b]. Forest harvest cutblocks with harvest years greater than 1990 were filtered and used as targets for the projections.

All data sets were accessed using the `bcdata` R package and filtered to the extent of the Revelstoke TSA [@teucher2021].

## Road Projection Methods

We developed the `roads` R package to project where new roads will be built based on the existing road network, locations of expected resource extraction (i.e. harvest cutblocks) and the landscape connecting the two. There are several different methods available for solving this problem, including snapping, least cost paths, dynamic least cost paths and minimum spanning trees. Snapping follows a straight line between the existing road and each cutblock regardless of the intervening landscape. The least cost paths (LCP) method uses Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm [-@dijkstra1959] to determine the optimal path between a cutblock and the existing road based on the cost of building a road at any point between the two. The path to each cutblock is determined independently of the other cutblocks. The dynamic least cost paths (DLCP) method uses the same LCP algorithm but evaluates the path to each cutblock in sequence so that earlier paths are considered in the cost for later paths. The sequence is detemined by a heuristic such as the distance to the existing road. Finally, the minimum spanning tree (MST) method builds on the LCP method by determining the least cost path between all cutblocks and the road and between each cutblock. Then the minimum spanning tree connecting all cutblocks to the road is solved using Kruskal's algorithm [-@kruskal1956]. (See Appendix X for a more detailed explanation of these methods). In the remainder of this paper, we focus on the DLCP and MST approaches which are better aligned with how road networks are designed.

In addition to the projection methods included in the `roads` package we also applied the Forest Road Network Plugin for QGIS by Clément Hardy (<https://github.com/Klemet/ForestRoadNetworkPluginForQGIS>), hereafter referred to as the Hardy QGIS method. This plugin uses a similar DLCP algorithm to the `roads` package and uses the distance to the closest roads to order the cutblocks.

```{r fig2, fig.cap="The roads package includes several different algorithms for building road networks, as well as methods for selecting landing locations within forest harvest cublocks. The algorithms include minimum spanning trees (MST), dynamic least cost paths (DLCP) and least cost paths (LCP). Landing locations can be selected as the centroid of the cutblock, or by taking a random or regularly spaced sample of points inside the cutblock at a given density. Target cutblocks are shown by grey lines, existing roads by black lines, projected roads by yellow lines, observed roads by red lines, and the cost of road building by the grey shading."}

```

## Analysis

We used the development of roads in the Revelstoke TSA from 1990 to the present as a case study to compare the MST, DCLP and Hardy QGIS road projection methods. We also explored the effects of the cost surface resolution and different methods of selecting landing points within cutblocks by repeating the MST projections with several variations of the input parameters. We compared two resolutions for the cost surface by aggregating the 100m resolution cost raster to a coarser 1000 m resolution. We also compared methods for locating landing points within cutblocks by using the polygon centroid and regularly spaced and random points, with point densities of 1 and 10 pts/km^2^ (Figure \@ref(fig:fig2)). The MST projection method was used for all the variations of parameters described above and an additional projection was run using the DLCP method with regularly spaced, high density landings. To allow comparisons, we also included a cutblocks only projection which did not project roads but assumed all disturbances were with in cutblocks. For the Hardy QGIS plugin we input the 100 m resolution cost raster, cutblocks, and road network data. We kept all the default settings except for the skidding distance which was set to 200m. Note that a skidding distance of 200 m corresponds to \~ 9 pts/km^2^. This resulted in a total of 15 road projection variants to be compared (Table 2).

In order to assess the performance of the projections, the following characteristics of the projected and observed road networks were calculated and compared: 1) Road presence, whether or not roads are present in each pixel; 2) Road disturbance footprint, 1 km buffer around roads [@ibisch2016a]; 3) Forestry disturbance footprint, a 500 m buffer around roads and cutblocks; 4) Road density, density of roads in meters per hectare (m/ha); 5) Distance to nearest road, distance from each raster cell to the nearest road. The forestry disturbance footprint follows the anthropogenic disturbance metric used for boreal caribou [@johnson2020], and was calculated using the `caribouMetrics` R package [@hughes]. Road density is an important metric that is often used when studying anthropogenic impacts on wildlife [@beazley2004]. Road density was calculated using the rasterizeLineDensity function within the `caribouMetrics` package. Distance to nearest road was calculated with a fast moving window method using the getDistFromSource function of the `roads` package. All road characteristics were stored in raster format.

The aspatial accuracy of the projections was assessed by calculating the mean values of each road network characteristic and comparing the projected and observed values. This was done across the TSA and at the cutblock level, where metric rasters were masked by the cutblock polygons and the means were taken only from within cutblocks.

The projections were assessed for their spatial accuracy in two different ways. First, difference maps were created by subtracting the road presence rasters of the projected networks with the observed network in order to highlight discrepancies between the networks. The observed and projected road networks were then overlain on the difference maps and regions of major discrepancies were investigated using Google satellite imagery in QGIS to investigate potential causes of the discrepancy. Secondly, the performance of each projection for the three binary characteristics (road presence, road disturbance footprint, and forestry disturbance footprint) was assessed. All pixels in the projected networks fell into 5 categories when compared with the observed raster: 1) pre-existing roads; 2) agree roadless, both projected and observed show no roads; 3) agree roaded, both projected and observed show new roads; 4) false positive, the projection showed a road but no roads were observed; and 5) false negative, the projection showed no roads but a road was observed. These categories were summarized for each projection and characteristic and used to calculate the performance metrics sensitivity, precision and F-measure [@lee2021]. Sensitivity, also known as recall, gives the proportion of the true positives that were projected, while precision gives the proportion of positives projected that are true. Sensitivity will be lower when observed roads are missed and precision will be lower when roads are projected that were not observed. F-measure attempts to balance sensitivity and precision to give an overall score.

# Results

## Aspatial performance

For each projection method the aspatial projection performance varied widely across the 5 road network characteristics and between the within cutblock and overall scales (Figure \@ref(fig:fig3)). The buffering based characteristics, the road and forestry disturbance footprints, performed best within cutblocks while the other characteristics, presence, density and distance to nearest road, performed better across the whole landscape. Across the whole landscape the the road and forestry disturbance footprints and distance to nearest roads were the closest to the observed mean, while the road presence and density characteristics were underestimated. The road density and distance to road metrics were the most sensitive to pixel size and were less accurate when the coarse cost raster was used (\@ref(fig:figA1)).

When comparing between projection methods we found that the density of landing points chosen within cutblocks affected the results, with the high density method underestimating the road density and road presence metrics less than the low density and centroid methods. The sampling method for choosing points in the cutblocks, either random or regular, did not have a large effect on the results. Hardy's QGIS plugin performed well at the overall scale but tended to overestimate the amount of roads within cutblocks.

## Spatial performance

Using difference maps to highlight areas of poor projections we found several potential causes of discrepancy. In most areas the projections remained within a reasonable vicinity of the observed roads and also realistically remained within valley bottoms without cutting across natural barriers such as mountains (Figure \@ref(fig:fig4)b). However, the cost raster was not detailed enough to reflect the costs of crossing streams or wet areas in valley bottoms and so the projections often cross the valley more than the observed roads, which typically have two parallel roads on either side of the valley. In addition, the projected roads were not able to match the switchback pattern of observed roads in steep terrain (Figure \@ref(fig:fig4)b). There were also instances where cutblocks included in the data set appear to be misidentified and are not accessed by the observed road network (Figure \@ref(fig:fig4)c).

As expected all the projection methods preformed worst with the road presence metric (F-Measure: `r perf_tbl_rng["Road presence"]`), while the forestry disturbance footprint performed best (F-Measure: `r perf_tbl_rng["Forestry disturbance\nfootprint"]`) and road disturbance footprint only slightly worse (F-Measure: `r perf_tbl_rng["Road disturbance footprint"]`). For the road presence metric higher sampling densities led to somewhat higher F-measure scores caused by fewer false negatives and only slightly more false positives. For the forestry and road disturbance footprint metrics, the F-measure was similar across projection methods.

# Discussion

Through assessing the performance of our model by comparing its spatial and aspatial accuracy with the observed forest road network following 1990, we are satisfied that the projections provide adequate results given their intended use, and that it is a useful tool for projecting forest road networks across a large landscape with minimal input parameters. However, for applications where the exact location of roads is important (like operational road engineering purposes), or for projecting impacts on wildlife that respond to roads at a very fine spatial scale then this is not an appropriate model. The model does, however, have potential to be a useful tool for predicting impacts on wildlife across large landscape simulations and could easily be incorporated as an element into more complex models that take into account other landscape phenomena such as wildfires, climate change, etc. Because this model does not take timescales into account, it could be a useful post-processing tool as an element of more complex models as it can be applied retroactively to landscape simulations.

Many of the major discrepancies between the projections and the observed network had to do with potential issues with the available data. Often major discrepancies were related to cutblocks that were likely incorrectly labelled (most often through LANDSAT change detection) in places where there weren't actually cutblocks. These discrepancies had a negative influence on the overall spatial and aspatial accuracy of the projections. In order to get more accurate road projections, one could simply remove the cutblocks derived from LANDSAT as these were often the cutblocks which caused issues, however, these cutblocks were left in as a major goal of this assessment was to create road projections while adjusting input parameters as little as possible. Considering how this model will be used to simulate forest roads moving into the future, it is unlikely that potential future cutblocks will be mislabelled as they were in our situation and this would not be an issue. Another potential issue was with roads not being included in the data set that were seen in the satellite imagery. This issue relates to results from the study by Poley et al (in review) that demonstrated how road network datasets are almost universally incomplete and that many low-use roads (such as forest resource roads) can be seen within recent satellite imagery but are not included in any readily available road datasets. Mapping of roads is often especially lacking in more rural, forested, and mountainous regions where roads are often unpaved (Prendes et al., 2017) with the Auditor General of British Columbia (2017) suggesting that 100 000 km of resource roads are missing from publicly-available road network maps (inspired by Adam Ford's doc). This means there were areas where the projections built a road, causing a discrepancy, but in reality there was actually an observed road there as seen in the satellite imagery. These discrepancies also negatively impacted the spatial and aspatial accuracy results when they shouldn't have and should be treated with caution. It is possible that some roads seen in the satellite images have since been closed which could be a reason for them being absent in the roads data sets. Again, this would not present an issue when predicting future impacts on landscapes, only when assessing the model accuracy in this context. Having said this, the projections were deemed most accurate in areas where the quality of the cutblock and road data was high and consistent with what was seen in recent satellite images.

Although this model works well in an area like Revelstoke where the road network is located in a region dominated by forestry roads, it does not work well in landscapes where roads are developed based on other targets outside of cutblocks (where the intent to build the road is not to achieve the least cost path; aka seismic lines). Fort Nelson TSA (TSA 8), for example, contains a large amount of non-forestry roads which are related to seismic lines, oil and gas extraction, etc. Because of this, forestry roads make up a much smaller percentage of the overall road network. In landscapes like this, it does not make sense to use the forestry road projections as many roads are influenced by many different factors. The model was attempted in the Fort Nelson TSA however the resulting road network (Figure A-1) did not accurately portray the observed network like it did in the Revelstoke TSA. However, other resource extraction activities could likely be incorporated into this model relatively easily. The same concept could be used where mining or oil locations could be used as target locations instead of cutblock areas.

It is also worth noting that although the model can project road networks fairly accurately across a large landscape, it may differ from the way in which roads are planned in real life. The model will simply build the roads in the least costly locations based on the cost surface, however often in the real world, roads must be planned around ownership and administrative boundaries. In BC, forestry roads are developed by forest licensees under a timber harvesting permit (Government of British Columbia, 2021c).

Certain projection methods were more accurate at projected some metrics compared to others. Similarly, certain metrics were sensitive to pixel size (road density, road presence) and others were not. Depending on what the goal of running the projections is, then the projection method and resolution may or may not play an important role. If you would like to predict road density as accurately as possible, then running the projections using as fine a resolution of cost surface as possible is the best option. If you're wanting to only predict roughly the location of the roads/save computing time and are more interested in a larger area, then a coarse resolution may suit these requirements perfectly fine. The tradeoffs of using a coarser resolution of cost surface may be less extreme when projecting roads across a flatter landscape compared to a mountainous landscape like was used for this paper since there would likely be less variability in cost across larger areas.

With caribou being one of the key considerations when managing some forestry areas (like in British Columbia TSAs, including Revelstoke TSA) (Government of British Columbia, 2021), the accuracy at which "roads" can project this forestry disturbance footprint metric could allow for this package to be a truly beneficial tool for assessing the impacts towards at-risk caribou populations when looking at various forest harvest scenarios. Because caribou are also considered an umbrella species within forests (Drever et al., 2019), projecting forestry impacts on their habitats may also provide valuable insight towards other key species as well. With the input of future cutblocks and the projections of forest road networks to these cutblocks, the results from the projection can provide a great outlook at the impacts of forestry scenarios on woodland caribou habitats using the forestry disturbance footprint metric. The distance to nearest road metric appears to be a very interesting metric to consider as well when looking specifically at larger areas. Using this metric to make projections at larger scales, such as at a TSA level, may provide very beneficial information about forestry impacts especially in a wildlife context when assessing the influence of forestry on various species with different tolerances to disturbance.

Further improvements could be made that would increase the accuracy of the model. The cost surface used for this paper was developed at a provincial scale, however, a higher resolution cost surface with more detail could further improve the accuracy of the projection results. A finer resolution cost surface with more detail will ultimately create a more realistic road network and would possibly allow for more accuracy within cutblocks (where fine micro-topography, water tables, etc. will play a role in road development). The downside being that it would also increase computing time and may not always be necessary depending on the application of the model, especially when using the model for a large-scale landscape. Adding too much complexity to the cost surface may also take away from the goal of this model to be simple and easy to use, however, the algorithm itself would work on a very fine and detailed cost surface. Along with increased computing time, a key limitation of using this model on a finer cost surface would be that eventually cost pixels would need to have directionality associated with them, which is something this model does not take into account. The accuracy of comparing the projections to the observed network could also simply be improved by using higher quality/more up to date road and cutblock data.

Assessing the performance of this model also presented some unique challenges with comparing two networks with each other across a landscape. We needed to carefully think about what we were trying to achieve. The goal wasn't to present a model that matched the observed road network pixel by pixel, but instead was to simulate disturbance across a large-scale landscape to an acceptable level while still being a relatively simple and straightforward tool. It's for this reason why metrics were chosen that are commonly used in road impact assessments on wildlife; such as the road density and forestry disturbance footprint metrics. Once the vector networks were converted into these raster layers, it also facilitated comparing observed versus projected as we could compare the means across the TSA and study where pixels matched and didn't match. Incorporating these metrics into landscape level simulations is also a realistic goal for this tool (ie projecting forest road density across a landscape) so a goal was to therefore see how well the model did at simulating these metrics when compared to the observed landscape.

Many spatial stochastic models don't include road projections at all in their simulations (Bergeron et al., 2017; DeLong & Tanner, 1996; Naderializadeh & Crowe, 2020; Perera & Cui, 2010). Our model could be relatively easily incorporated, or applied retroactively, to similar spatial stochastic simulations such as these. For large-scale projects such as the Western Boreal Initiative (Environment Canada, date?) that simulate many complex factors across a landscape, our forest road projection methods could be incorporated as one element within the overall landscape simulations.

-The road presence metric is sensitive to small differences in road location while the road density metric is sensitive to variations in the curves of tightly packed roads within grid cells that cannot be modeled using this algorithm.

# Conclusion

The forest road network projection model presented here provides an effective way to project forest road networks that are suitable for large scale landscape simulations with relatively little effort. This model, however, is not suitable for strategic planning. The results from our projections in our study area overall matched up adequately with the observed present day forest road networks, with major discrepancies being attributed to issues in the available road and cutblock data. These discrepancies would not be issues in future landscape simulations, only when assessing accuracy. In areas where the quality of the data was high, projections matched well with the observed network. Our metrics were able to be projected effectively across a large landscape and could be useful indicators of impacts on wildlife habitats in future simulations.

This model was developed with the goal of being simple to use, readily accessible, and relatively accurate across a large landscape. With minimal input parameters, complexity, and computational power, one can project future forest road networks using this tool across large areas which can aid in the assessment of potential impacts of forestry disturbance on wildlife and habitat over a large spatial scale. With land use activities transforming a large proportion of the planet's land surface and becoming an issue of global importance (Foley et al., 2005), there is an increasing need to improve and build upon landscape level models in order to properly manage and protect remaining natural habitats. Land-use activities, primarily for agricultural expansion and timber extraction, have caused a net loss of \~7 to 11 million km2 of forest in the past 300 years (Foley et al., 2005). With only 7% of the planet's roadless areas being larger than 100 square kilometers, there is a need to protect key areas which sustain key refugia for biodiversity from fragmentation and degradation (Ibisch et al., 2016). The introduction of this widely applicable and user-friendly forest resource road model is a step in the right direction for providing more tools to land managers and planners who are interested in assessing the potential impacts of road development over large landscapes.

## Road network projection methods

Various optimization and simulation techniques have been used for projecting forestry roads into the future and across landscapes, however, we focused on the simulation methods that link multiple harvest units (a.k.a cutblocks) to an existing road network for strategic purposes. Dean (1997) described this road projection problem as the multiple target access problem (MTAP), where the objective is to find the minimum-cost locations for new roadways that link forested stands or landings (i.e., log deck) to the existing road network. We used three methods for solving the MTAP in the roads package. These methods represent a gradient of computational complexity and operational detail, starting with the least complicated or the snapping approach, followed by the least cost paths approach (LCP) and finally, the minimum spanning tree approach (MST). In the remainder of this paper, we will focus on the LCP and MST approaches given their assumptions are well aligned with how forestry professionals would strategically design road networks.

LCP approach solves the MTAP by decomposing the problem into several smaller problems called single target access problems (STAP). For each STAP, a least cost path from a single source to sink was solved using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm (1959). Dijkstra's algorithm minimizes the distance between a landing and the current road network, subject to costs or penalties incurred from road construction and travel (the details of this process are described later in the section "weighted graph"). Each STAP was then solved sequentially, with the newly projected roadway updating the existing road network and subsequently the costs of road construction. This method was first developed by Anderson and Nelson (2004) and provides a feasible solution to the MTAP, however the projected network is sensitive to the ordering of the STAP. They recommended a heuristic for connecting the landings and finding optimal branch locations to deal with this sensitivity.

The MST approach extends the LCP approach by providing a heuristic for linking landings or evaluating road branching opportunities. Dean (1997) showed that heuristics with branch evaluation were able to reproduce 80% of the observed road locations in their study area. Our MST approach has three steps towards evaluating branch locations while projecting roads: 1) estimate the least cost paths that link each of the landings and the least cost paths that link each landing to the existing road network, 2) creating a weighted graph where each node is either a landing or point on the existing road network and each edge or arc is weighted by the costs estimated in the previous step and 3) solving the minimum spanning tree for this graph. The minimum spanning tree was solved using Kruskal's algorithm (1956) where every node in the graph was linked to form a tree such that the sum of edge weights is minimized, and the links do not form a loop. This method was most similar to Clark et al. (2000) approach which used a minimum spanning tree to project simple road networks during harvest scheduling. An important difference was that they based the edge weights on spatial Euclidean distance, whereas the MST approach used the costs estimated from least cost paths.

A projection created with the Forest Road Network Plugin for QGIS by Clement (2021) was also created within QGIS and added to the analysis in order to see how it compared with our projection methods. All the default settings such as skidding distance, etc. were left as they were within the QGIS plugin.

## Weighted graph

A mathematical weighted graph consisting of nodes and edges was used to parameterize either Kruskal's or Dijkstra's algorithms. When solving least cost paths using Dijkstra's algorithm, each node in the graph corresponded to a pixel in a raster of our study area (100m x 100m resolution). Whereas, in the graph used for solving the minimum spanning tree via Kruskal's algorithm, each node represented either a landing or a point on the existing road network. Therefore, a node can be represented by any one of three attributes in the forest road network: (i) a landing, (ii) a point on an existing road, or (iii) an intermediate point. The landing nodes represent log decks or sources of timber and the point on the existing road is the sink where the timber will end up. The intermediate points are plausible locations to construct a road and are thus free of barriers like major water bodies. [The edges connecting the nodes follow a "queens" case or allow a maximum of eight possible edges for a given node.]{.underline} Thus, our methods utilize a grid pattern which does not support curvature or switchbacks in road design as required in operational road design, thus we ascertain that our road projection methods are for strategic modelling purposes only. Edges are assigned weights which penalize the algorithm to account for various impedance and road construction costs. When solving least cost paths, a cost surface raster was used. The pixels of the cost surface raster corresponded to nodes in the weighted graph and thus the edge weight was the average cost between the two nodes or pixels. When solving the minimum spanning tree, the edge weight corresponded to the total cost of the least cost path between the two nodes.
