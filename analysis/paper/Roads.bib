	abstract = {Roads can result in negative effects on wildlife including habitat loss, behavioral avoidance, reduced survival, reproduction and gene flow. These road effects are especially pronounced for large mammals given their large home-range requirements and low reproductive rates. To counteract these negative effects, road mitigation measures, such as underpasses and overpasses, are promoted; however, future landscape changes are rarely considered when selecting mitigation locations. We used GPS telemetry data on female American black bears Ursus americanus to examine their response to roads in Massachusetts, US. We compared bear road crossing frequency with a null crossing model derived from a correlated random walk, estimated road crossing movement speeds, and fit a road-crossing resource selection function. We found that, though black bears crossed roads less than expected based on the null model, 10\% of their observed steps, on average, crossed roads. We also found bears crossed roads at higher movement speeds than during other home-range behaviors, and that bears preferred to cross smaller, less trafficked roads in areas with lower speed limits, less human development and more forest. We used the resource selection model to identify road segments for potential mitigation efforts and then used future human development projections to forecast future changes in these segments. We found a decrease of 15\% in the length of suitable mitigation segments from 2019 to 2050. Given the sizeable investment in wildlife crossing structures and their longevity on the landscape, we recommend incorporating future projections into crossing site selection to ensure the long-term viability of road mitigation efforts.},

	abstract = {1. Caribou and reindeer Rangifer tarandus are declining across North America and Scandinavia in part from wolf Canis lupus-mediated apparent competition with more abundant ungulate prey species. While caribou generally persist in areas with low wolf density, wolf packs that overlap caribou ranges could trigger caribou declines. Moreover, anthropogenic linear features such as roads, trails and seismic lines are hypothesized to increase predation risk for caribou, yet few studies have examined the mechanistic effects of linear features or spatial overlap on wolf–caribou encounter rates and predation risk. 2. We used (a) time-to-event models of wolf–caribou encounters estimated from concurrent global positioning system (GPS) radio-collar data from wolves and caribou and (b) wolf resource selection models of travel locations, to determine the potential influence of wolf–caribou spatial overlap, linear features, elevation and season on encounter rates. Analyses were based on data from 35 adult female caribou and 37 male and female wolves from 11 wolf packs from Banff and Jasper National Parks, Canada, from 2002 until 2010. 3. Wolf–caribou encounter rates increased with high wolf–caribou overlap, proximity to linear features and lower elevations. Wolves strongly selected low elevations, especially during winter and spring. Selection for linear features as travel routes increased with elevation. 4. Caribou risk of encounter was highest during the summer and autumn when wolves spent the most time at high elevations. Most wolf-caused mortalities (n = 12) occurred during spring and summer. 5. Synthesis and applications. The presence of anthropogenic linear features and the amount of time wolves spend in caribou range could be equally as important as wolf density when prioritizing caribou recovery actions such as wolf or primary prey reductions or re-introductions. The use of GPS locations and time-to-event modelling offers a powerful tool for evaluating factors affecting predation risk of threatened and endangered species.},

	abstract = {In the context of complex demands on forest resources and climate change, synoptic and spatially-explicit baseline data characterizing national trends in forest disturbance and subsequent return of vegetation (and eventual return to forest) are increasingly required. Time series analyses of remotely sensed data enable the retrospective generation of baseline data depicting both forest disturbance and recovery, enabling a more holistic examination of forest dynamics. In this research, we utilize the outputs of the Composite2Change, or C2C, algorithm that leverages the extensive Landsat archive to produce annual, gap-free, surface reflectance composites to date and label disturbance types and to characterize vegetation recovery over the {\textbackslash}textgreater 650 million ha of Canada's forested ecosystems. From 1985 to 2010, 57.5 Mha or 10.75\% of Canada's net forested ecosystem area (exclusive of water) were disturbed by either wildfire or harvest, representing an annual rate of disturbance of approximately 0.43\% per year. Wildfire accounted for 2.5 times more area disturbed than harvest. On average, wildfire disturbed 1.6 Mha annually and had greater inter-annual variability with a standard deviation of 1.1 Mha, compared to the 0.65 Mha disturbed annually by harvesting (σ = 0.1 Mha). Herein, we defined a longer-term measure of spectral recovery (the number of years it took for a pixel to attain 80\% of its pre-disturbance Normalized Burn Ratio or NBR value), which indicated that harvested areas are recovering more consistently over time relative to areas disturbed by wildfire, with 78.6\% of harvested areas requiring ≤ 10 years to recover, compared to only 35.5\% of wildfire areas. A shorter-term (5-year) measure of spectral recovery, also based on the NBR, indicated that vegetation in wildfire areas returned more rapidly than harvested areas; however, when the magnitude of the disturbance was incorporated into the metric, with magnitude typically larger and more variable for wildfire areas, harvested areas were found to be recovering more rapidly on average in the short-term. Overall, {\textbackslash}textless 1\% of the areas disturbed by wildfire and harvest were identified as non-recovering by all three spectral measures of recovery used in our analysis. Regionally, trends in disturbance and recovery largely echoed trends found at the national level, although the relative amounts and rates of wildfire or harvest varied by ecozone. Time series Landsat composites provide an opportunity to characterize relative trends in disturbance and recovery at a national scale, by disturbance type and ecozone, in a spatially explicit manner and at a level of spatial detail that is relevant to both forest management and science.},

We use data on traffic related deaths in badgers (Meles meles) in The Netherlands to illustrate that traffic mortality is higher on minor roads. We ask for a more extensive investigation of the environmental impacts of minor roads. Moreover, we argue that the success of mitigation on roads drastically increases when both major and minor roads are integrated in the planning of traffic flows. Therefore, we propose a strategy based on the concept of a "traffic-calmed area". Traffic-calmed areas create opportunities for wildlife by decreasing limitations for animal movement. We ask for further studies to estimate what size traffic-calmed areas should be to maintain minimum viable animal populations.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Roads are a widespread and increasing feature of most landscapes. We reviewed the scientific literature on the ecological effects of roads and found support for the general conclusion that they are associated with negative effects on biotic integrity in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Roads of all kinds have seven general effects: mortality from road construction, mortality from collision with vehicles, modification of animal behavior, alteration of the physical environment, alteration of the chemical environment, spread of exotics, and increased use of areas by humans. Road construction kills sessile and slow-moving organisms, injures organisms adjacent to a road, and alters physical conditions beneath a road. Vehicle collisions affect the demography of many species, both vertebrates and invertebrates; mitigation measures to reduce roadkill have been only partly successful. Roads alter animal behavior by causing changes in home ranges, movement, reproductive success, escape response, and physiological state. Roads change soil density, temperature, soil water content, light levels, dust, surface waters, patterns of runoff, and sedimentation, as well as adding heavy metals (especially lead), salts, organic molecules, ozone, and nutrients to roadside environments. Roads promote the dispersal of exotic species by altering habitats, stressing native species, and providing movement corridors. Roads also promote increased hunting, fishing, passive harassment of animals, and landscape modifications. Not all species and ecosystems are equally affected by roads, but overall the presence of roads is highly correlated with changes in species composition, population sizes, and hydrologic and geomorphic processes that shape aquatic and riparian systems. More experimental research is needed to complement post-hoc correlative studies. Our review underscores the importance to conservation of avoiding construction of new roads in roadless or sparsely roaded areas and of removal or restoration of existing roads to benefit both terrestrial and aquatic biota.},

Such models do not usually represent important processes explicitly related to climate change and harvesting, which limits their potential for predicting and understanding the future of boreal bird assemblages at the landscape scale. In this study, we attempted to assess the cumulative and specific impacts of both harvesting and climate-induced changes on wildfires and stand-level processes (e.g., reproduction, growth) in the boreal forest of eastern Canada. The projected changes in these landscape- and stand-scale processes (referred to as "drivers of change") were then assessed for their impacts on future habitats and potential productivity of black-backed woodpecker (BBWO; Picoides arcticus), a focal species representative of deadwood and old-growth biodiversity in eastern Canada. Forest attributes were simulated using a forest landscape model, LANDIS-II, and were used to infer future landscape suitability to BBWO under three anthropogenic climate forcing scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), compared to the historical baseline. We found climate change is likely to be detrimental for BBWO, with up to 92\% decline in potential productivity under the worst-case climate forcing scenario (RCP 8.5). However, large declines were also projected under baseline climate, underlining the importance of harvest in determining future BBWO productivity. Present-day harvesting practices were the single most important cause of declining areas of old-growth coniferous forest, and hence appeared as the single most important driver of future BBWO productivity, regardless of the climate scenario. Climate-induced increases in fire activity would further promote young, deciduous stands at the expense of old-growth coniferous stands. This suggests that the biodiversity associated with deadwood and old-growth boreal forests may be greatly altered by the cumulative impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances under a changing climate. Management adaptations, including reduced harvesting levels and strategies to promote coniferous species content, may help mitigate these cumulative impacts.},

	doi = {10.5194/essd-11-189-2019},
	abstract = {Many maps of open water and wetlands have been developed based on three main methods: (i) compiling national and regional wetland surveys,
(ii) identifying inundated areas via satellite imagery and (iii) delineating wetlands as shallow water table areas based on groundwater modeling. However, the resulting global wetland extents vary from 3 \% to 21 \% of the land surface area because of inconsistencies in wetland definitions and limitations in observation or modeling systems. To reconcile these differences, we propose composite wetland (CW) maps, combining two classes of wetlands: (1) regularly flooded wetlands (RFWs) obtained by overlapping selected open-water and inundation datasets; and (2) groundwater-driven wetlands (GDWs) derived from groundwater modeling (either direct or simplified using several variants of the topographic index). Wetlands are statically defined as areas with persistent near-saturated soil surfaces because of regular flooding or shallow groundwater, disregarding most human alterations (potential wetlands). Seven CW maps were generated at 15 arcsec resolution (ca. 500 m at the Equator) using geographic information system (GIS) tools and by combining one RFW and different GDW maps. To validate this approach, these CW maps were compared with existing wetland datasets at the global and regional scales. The spatial patterns were decently captured, but the wetland extents were difficult to assess compared to the dispersion of the validation datasets. Compared with the only regional dataset encompassing both GDWs and RFWs, over France, the CW maps performed well and better than all other considered global wetland datasets. Two CW maps, showing the best overall match with the available evaluation datasets, were eventually selected. These maps provided global wetland extents of 27.5 and
29 million km2, i.e., 21.1 \% and 21.6 \% of the global land area,
which are among the highest values in the literature and are in line with recent estimates also recognizing the contribution of GDWs. This wetland class covers 15 \% of the global land area compared with 9.7 \% for RFW (with an overlap of ca. 3.4 \%), including wetlands under canopy and/or cloud cover, leading to high wetland densities in the tropics and small scattered wetlands that cover less than 5 \% of land but are highly important for hydrological and ecological functioning in temperate to arid areas. By distinguishing the RFWs and GDWs based globally on uniform principles, the proposed dataset might be useful for large-scale land surface modeling (hydrological, ecological and biogeochemical modeling) and environmental planning. The dataset consisting of the two selected CW maps and the contributing GDW and RFW maps is available from PANGAEA at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.892657 (Tootchi et al., 2018).},

	abstract = {The development of hydrocarbon resources in northwestern Canada has resulted in a vast network of seismic lines. Seismic lines are a conservation concern because they are believed to alter the use of space by predators and ultimately change predator-prey relationships. Such changes are believed to be a key factor influencing declines in boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). Using remote wildlife cameras, we measured the behavioral response of a known caribou predator, the black bear (Ursus americanus), to seismic lines at 2 spatial scales. At the line scale, we compared black bear use of lines that varied in width and vegetation recovery state to undisturbed forest interior locations. At a 5-km2 scale, we compared the probability of bear use across a continuum of seismic line density. At both spatial scales, we also tested for an interaction between bear use of seismic lines and use of upland and lowland forest types. Black bears used most types of seismic lines more frequently than undisturbed forest interior and upland forest more than lowland forest. We found no evidence of an interaction between lines and forest type, as the relative difference in seismic line versus forest interior use was the same in lowland and upland forest. At the 5-km2 scale, we found no evidence of increased use of lowland forest in areas with greater seismic line density. Thus, seismic lines did not appear to increase black bear use of lowland forest types per se. However, bears used seismic lines more than forest interiors, which might alter their ability to locate and capture caribou and other ungulate prey, thereby creating the potential for altered predator-prey dynamics in landscapes with seismic lines. Bears do not appear to use seismic lines ≤2 m wide more often than the forest interior. We suggest that where new seismic lines are constructed, those seismic lines should be a maximum width of 2 m to reduce the potential for altered predator-prey dynamics in areas being developed for oil and gas extraction. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {We used the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area in northeast British Columbia, Canada as a case study to determine potential conflicts between future resource development and high-value habitats of large mammals in an undeveloped boreal landscape. More than 50 \% of high-value habitats for caribou, moose, elk, wolves and grizzly bears were located in Special Resource Management Zones, where natural resource developments could occur. We developed geographic information system (GIS) layers of potential forest resources, oil and gas, minerals, wind power, all resources combined, and roads; and quantified the proportions of high-value habitats overlapping these potentials. Greater proportions of high-value habitats across seasons for moose, elk, and wolves overlapped areas with high cumulative resource potential (winter, 49–70 \%, growing season, 35–63 \%) more than for three other species (grizzly bears, Stone’s sheep, mountain goats). This pattern was similar for forest resources, oil and gas, wind power, and roads. Caribou were more seasonally influenced. The proportions of their high-value habitat in areas with high cumulative resource potential (winter, 53 \%, growing season, 16 \%), as well as high forest and oil and gas potentials, were greatest in winter; in contrast, overlap with high mineral potential was greatest during the growing season. We recommend a quantitative and visual GIS approach to scenario planning in the Muskwa-Kechika to maintain the abundance and diversity of wildlife populations there. Resource development would likely increase early seral habitats, presumably benefiting moose, elk, and wolves, but could adversely affect caribou and grizzly bears through habitat loss and increased access.},

	abstract = {Mountain forests provide a wide range of ecosystem services (ES, e.g., timber production, protection from natural hazards, maintaining biodiversity) and are especially sensitive to climate change. Dynamic vegetation models are commonly used to project climate change impacts on forests, but the sensitivity of process-based forest landscape models (FLMs) to uncertainties in climate input data has received little attention, especially regarding the response of ES. Using a dry inner-Alpine valley in Switzerland as a case study, we tested the sensitivity of a process-based FLM to different baseline climate data, lapse rates, and future climate change derived from different climate model combination chains and downscaling methods. Under the current climate, different sources of baseline climate accounted for the majority of the variation at lower elevations, while differences in lapse rates caused large variability at higher elevations. Under climate change, differences between climate model chains were the greatest source of uncertainty. In general, the largest differences for species were found at their individual regional distribution limits, and the largest differences for ES were found at the highest elevations. Thus, our results suggest that the greatest uncertainty for simulating forest ES is due to differences between climate model chains, and we recommend using as many climate scenarios as possible when projecting future forest response to climate change. In addition, care should be taken when evaluating climate impacts at landscape locations that are known a priori to be sensitive to climate variation, such as high-elevation forests.},

	abstract = {Quantifying resource use or selection by valued species on a human-altered landscape is important for wise conservation action. Here, we contrast metrics of resource selection based on Global Positioning System (GPS) telemetry, which indexes time spent in various habitats, with tracking in snow, which measures distance travelled. When animals move at different speeds within different habitats, the two methods can produce different results. The study was conducted in winter on endangered mountain caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in a landscape fragmented by forestry roads and cutblocks. From 2001 to 2009, 25 caribou were monitored with GPS collars obtaining locations every two to six hours, and compared to 63 caribou trails followed in snow in the same study area and time period. Logistic regression was used to estimate selection for both metrics, with the same definition of use and availability employed. Forest age, tree species, edge distances, and road densities were the covariates of interest. For most covariates, the two metrics produced similar results that agreed with the literature: selection for primary forest stands that represent forage patches. Both metrics indicated selection for habitat edges that potentially enhance foraging. The distance metric (snow trailing) indicated strong selection for forestry roads (42\% more than available), whereas GPS locations suggested an avoidance of roads (33\% less than available). The GPS analysis was in agreement with the vast majority of work published on woodland caribou, whereas the distance metric suggests some of the first evidence of selection for anthropogenic linear features. Our results highlight a potential bias against detecting selection for habitat features used for movement when using long fix intervals ({\textgreater}2 h) that typify most GPS studies. Avoidance of linear features should be carefully examined and designs considered to asses this bias. Finally, the selection of roads by caribou exacerbates an already desperate situation by creating a potential trap because roads are also preferred by some predators.},

	abstract = {Protected Areas (PAs) are a main conservation tool to halt biodiversity loss. However, their performance has been often questioned and the need to improve their effectiveness is now more apparent than ever. Here, we propose Roadless Areas as a conservation target to increase the cover and effectiveness of PAs. Roadless Areas represent natural and semi-natural areas of high conservation value that have no or little traffic and provide multiple ecosystem services. Here, we develop a methodological framework to identify Roadless Areas in Europe and assess their spatial properties and conservation status. We examine how the European Union's conservation network, Natura 2000, would expand if Roadless Areas that are already partially included in Natura 2000 terrestrial sites or are adjacent to them would be added to the existing conservation network. We find that European lands are highly fragmented. Roadless Areas are unevenly distributed, and cover more than 30\% of the European Union territory, with large Roadless Areas (≥100 km2) occupying about 18\% of that surface. At the national level, there is a large variation in the percentage of overlap between Natura 2000 sites and Roadless Areas, with the Natura 2000 network currently encompassing between 19 and 89\% of the Roadless Areas surface, depending on the member state. Our results demonstrate that Roadless Areas adjacent to Natura 2000 sites cover {\textgreater}65\% of the total Natura 2000 surface. As Roadless Areas have limited human access, we suggest integrating Roadless Areas into biodiversity conservation networks as a timely solution to minimize conflicts over expanding PAs in the European Union and to achieve the goals of the European Union's 2020 Biodiversity Strategy.},

	abstract = {Logging negatively affects the threatened forest-dwelling caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) through its positive effects on large predator populations. As recruitment is a key component of caribou population growth rate, we assessed calving rates of females and calf survival rates during the most critical period for calf survival, the calving period. We also identified causes of calf mortality and investigated the influence of predation risk, food availability, and human disturbance on habitat selection of females during the calving period at both the home-range and forest stand scales. We hypothesized that caribou should display habitat selection patterns to reduce predation risk at both scales. Using telemetry, we followed 22 females and their calves from 2004 to 2007 in a highly managed study area in Québec, Canada. Most females (78.5 ± 0.05 [SE]) gave birth each year, but only 46.3 ± 8.0\% of the calves survived during the first 50 days following birth, and 57.3 ± 14.9\% of them died from black bear (Ursus americanus) predation. At the home-range scale, caribou selected calving areas located at upper slope positions and avoided high road density areas. Surprisingly, they also selected the forested habitat type having the lowest lateral cover (mixed and deciduous stands) while avoiding the highest cover (regenerating conifer stands). At the forest stand scale, caribou selected areas located at relatively high elevations and with a lower basal area of black spruce trees. The selection of upper slope positions likely favored spatial segregation between calving females and wolves (Canis lupus) but not black bear. Our results suggest that calving females used areas from which they could visually detect approaching predators. While wolf avoidance appeared to be effective in a highly managed landscape, caribou did not appear to have adjusted their predator avoidance strategy to the recent increase in black bear abundance, who have benefited from increased food abundance. This situation requires focused attention from wildlife managers as logging activities are progressing towards the north within the core of forest-dwelling caribou range. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {Populations of boreal and southern mountain caribou in Alberta, Canada, are declining, and the ultimate cause of their decline is believed to be anthropogenic disturbance. Linear features are pervasive across the landscape, and of particular importance, seismic lines established in the 1900s (legacy seismic lines) are slow to regenerate. Off-highway vehicles are widely used on these seismic lines and can hamper vegetative re-growth because of ongoing physical damage, compaction, and active clearing. Restoration of seismic lines within caribou range is therefore a priority for the recovery of threatened populations in Alberta, but a triage-type approach is necessary to prioritize restoration and ensure conservation resources are wisely spent. To target restoration efforts, our objective was to determine factors that best explained levels of off-highway vehicles use on seismic lines intersecting roads. We investigated the relative importance of local topography, vegetation attributes of seismic lines, and broad-scale human factors such as the density of infrastructures and the proximity to recreation campsites and towns to explain the observed levels of off-highway vehicles use. We found that off-highway vehicles use was mainly associated with local topography and vegetation attributes of seismic lines that facilitated ease-of-travel. Broad-scale landscape attributes associated with industrial, recreation access, or hunting activities did not explain levels of off-highway vehicles use. Management actions aimed at promoting natural regeneration and reduce ease-of-travel on legacy seismic lines within caribou ranges can be beneficial to caribou recovery in Alberta, Canada, and we therefore recommend restrictions of off-highway vehicles use on low vegetation, dry seismic lines in caribou ranges.},

Next, we use the declining southern mountain population of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in British Columbia, Canada as a case study to show that identification of critical habitat does not guarantee its protection on non-federal lands. Our analyses show that 909 km2 of critical habitat identified on provincial lands were logged in 5 years after it was legally identified under SARA. Existing provincial legislation and policies have provided incomplete protection of caribou critical habitat, and Canada's federal government has yet to exercise authority under SARA that could protect these areas. In the absence of nondiscretionary protection under provincial legislation, a combination of alternative mechanisms, involving all levels of government, Indigenous people, and industry, will be essential to protect critical habitat and help recover species at risk.},

	abstract = {Predator-prey interactions, including between large mammalian wildlife species, can be represented as a “space race”, where prey try to minimize and predators maximize spatial overlap. Human activity can also influence the distribution of wildlife species. In particular, high-human disturbance can displace large carnivore predators, a trait-mediated direct effect. Predator displacement by humans could then indirectly benefit prey species by reducing predation risk, a trait-mediated indirect effect of humans that spatially decouples predators from prey. The purpose of this research was to test the hypothesis that high-human activity was displacing predators and thus indirectly creating spatial refuge for prey species, helping prey win the “space race”. We measured the occurrence of eleven large mammal species (including humans and cattle) at 43 camera traps deployed on roads and trails in southwest Alberta, Canada. We tested species co-occurrence at camera sites using hierarchical cluster and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) analyses; and tested whether human activity, food and/or habitat influenced predator and prey species counts at camera sites using regression tree analysis. Cluster and NMS analysis indicated that at camera sites humans co-occurred with prey species more than predator species and predator species had relatively low co-occurrence with prey species. Regression tree analysis indicated that prey species were three times more abundant on roads and trails with {\textgreater}32 humans/day. However, predators were less abundant on roads and trails that exceeded 18 humans/day. Our results support the hypothesis that high-human activity displaced predators but not prey species, creating spatial refuge from predation. High-human activity on roads and trails (i.e., {\textgreater}18 humans/day) has the potential to interfere with predator-prey interactions via trait-mediated direct and indirect effects. We urge scientist and managers to carefully consider and quantify the trait-mediated indirect effects of humans, in addition to direct effects, when assessing human impacts on wildlife and ecosystems.},

An integrated understanding of species dispersal is essential for demographic modelling and conservation planning. Here, we review the dispersal patterns and determinants documented in the scientific literature for the grey wolf (Canis lupus) across its distribution range. We showed a surprisingly high variability within and among study areas on all dispersal parameters – dispersal rate, direction, distance, duration and success. We found that such large variability is due to multiple individual, social and environmental determinants, but also due to previously overlooked methodological research issues. We revealed a potential non-linear relationship between dispersal rate and population density, with dispersal rate higher at both ends of the gradient of population density. We found that human-caused mortality reduces distance, duration and success of dispersal events. Furthermore, dispersers avoid interaction with humans, and highly exposed areas like agricultural lands hamper population connectivity in many cases. We identified numerous methodological research problems that make it difficult to obtain robust estimates of dispersal parameters and robust inferences on dispersal patterns and their determinants. In particular, analyses where confounding factors were not accounted for led to substantial knowledge gaps on all aspects of dispersal in an otherwise much-studied species. Our understanding of wolf biology and management would significantly benefit if wolf dispersal studies reported the results and possible factors affecting wolf dispersal more transparently.},

Yet current global road maps are typically outdated or characterized by spatial bias in coverage. In the Global Roads Inventory Project we gathered, harmonized and integrated nearly 60 geospatial datasets on road infrastructure into a global roads dataset. The resulting dataset covers 222 countries and includes over 21 million km of roads, which is two to three times the total length in the currently best available country-based global roads datasets. We then related total road length per country to country area, population density, GDP and OECD membership, resulting in a regression model with adjusted R2 of 0.90, and found that that the highest road densities are associated with densely populated and wealthier countries. Applying our regression model to future population densities and GDP estimates from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios, we obtained a tentative estimate of 3.0–4.7 million km additional road length for the year 2050. Large increases in road length were projected for developing nations in some of the world’s last remaining wilderness areas, such as the Amazon, the Congo basin and New Guinea. This highlights the need for accurate spatial road datasets to underpin strategic spatial planning in order to reduce the impacts of roads in remaining pristine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Prey may trade off resource acquisition with mortality risk by using various habitat selection strategies. Empirical assessments have shown that the functional and numerical responses of predators to human disturbances are variable, yet spatial changes in predation risk by two predators have seldom been studied for prey occurring in human-modified landscapes. Using the boreal caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou – grey wolf Canis lupus – black bear Ursus americanus system in eastern Canada, we investigated whether responses of prey towards one predator could concomitantly increase risk of predation from another predator exhibiting a different foraging tactic. We investigated trade-offs made by solitary caribou females and mothers accompanied by their calf during the period of highest calf vulnerability and compared the behaviour of mothers that would eventually lose their calf to predation to that of mothers whose calf survived until the following year. We modelled habitat selection using different metrics of forage based on field measurements and digital maps and developed empirical models of predation risk and prey behaviour using GPS data collected on both predators and prey. Mothers accompanied by their calf seemed to compromise foraging opportunities for safety, as opposed to solitary females who showed no particular avoidance of areas used by predators. Although caribou mothers adopted selection strategies that could have protected their offspring from wolves, females that eventually lost their calf to predation selected for vegetative associations that were favourable to bears. Synthesis and applications. We determined that mothers that most strongly avoided suitable wolf habitat were also those that most strongly selected suitable bear habitat, suggesting that by using antipredator strategies aimed at reducing predation risk from wolves, caribou exposed their offspring to increased predation risk from bears. This result is of paramount conservation value as bears were responsible for 94\% of caribou calf kills in this system. In the short term, conservation efforts for boreal caribou may benefit from the management of bear populations by means of liberal hunting regulations or predator control. In the long term, however, these actions should be used in conjunction with the protection of potential calving areas away from cutblocks and roads.},

	abstract = {We assessed habitat selection of moose in a study area containing 2 highways and a network of forest roads in Quebec, Canada. We tested the hypothesis that roadways would affect moose habitat selection and that moose behaviour would vary with time, proximity to roads, type of roadway, and environmental characteristics (i.e., habitat and topography). We equipped 47 moose with GPS telemetry collars and assessed habitat selection using resource selection functions. Moose searched primarily for areas with high forage availability, but they also avoided highways and forest roads, although avoidance usually disappeared beyond 100–250 m. Avoidance was not directly proportional to noise disturbance; moose systematically avoided the first 100 m adjacent to forest roads, while habitats adjacent to highway sides were sometimes used in proportion to their availability. The benefits of using habitats adjacent to highways may be greater than the costs to moose, which was not always the case for forest roads. The road-avoidance zone varied seasonally but was generally wider for males than females, suggesting that males were more sensitive to road disturbance. We believe that moose frequent highways and associated roadsides to find food and mineral salts, and possibly to reduce predation risk for females. Topography was also an important correlate of habitat selection by moose, especially for females, which had significant selection coefficients for altitude and slope in almost every season. Proper assessment of human impacts on ungulates in natural environments requires consideration of unpaved forest roads. In a study area with a small human footprint and low road density (0.16 km·km−2), moose selection patterns suggested they minimized potential risks associated with highways at the coarse scale while seeking short-term benefits of highway roadsides, i.e., sodium in vegetation and pools, at the finer spatial scale.},

	abstract = {Linear features are increasing worldwide and, in many jurisdictions, their decommissioning has been identified as a way to restore wildlife habitat. Few studies have assessed restoration practices on forest roads, yet they are the main linear disturbance throughout most circumboreal forests. In boreal forests of eastern Canada, such knowledge would be especially valuable for the conservation of boreal populations of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). We assessed the short-term establishment of vegetation following four treatments applied across 40 km of forest roads, along a restoration gradient involving additive treatments (i.e. each successive treatment included the treatments prior): closing the road to traffic, decompacting the soil, planting black spruce trees, and adding enriched soil. We linked lateral cover (a proxy of movement obstruction for wildlife) and the occurrence and abundance of plant species to road treatments and environmental covariates. Vegetation establishment 3–4 years after decommissioning was mostly influenced by treatments but also by road width and stand composition in the vicinity of roads. The combination of closing, decompacting, and planting was the most effective treatment to establish regeneration that would lead to suitable caribou habitat as it reduced food availability for moose and bears (i.e. lower presence of herbaceous species, fruit-bearing shrubs, and deciduous trees). It also reduced the presence of plants competing with spruce, such as ericaceous shrubs. Our results suggest that the decommissioning of forest roads could benefit caribou, provided it is performed at a sufficiently broad scale, and accompanied by other habitat restoration and protection practices.},

As part of that process, growth-inducing infrastructure, such as electrical transmission lines, export facilities, and roads, presents nonincremental changes in where and how natural resources are exploited. These projects open intact areas, induce or intensify industrial development, and accelerate carbon emissions. The direct impacts of large-scale infrastructure are widely acknowledged and policy and legislation exists to account for them in environmental decisions. Yet, decision makers often ignore the secondary, growth-induced effects, even though they can outweigh the impacts of the initial development. Given the extensive area and magnitude of such impacts, we argue that regulatory or funding approvals for growth-inducing infrastructure represent keystone decisions. Credible approval processes require the consideration of the full range of impacts resulting from the ensuing growth. This will necessitate a shift in assessment thinking, from the traditional focus on the immediate project footprint to one that recognizes the sustainability implications of approving infrastructure that will transform the trajectory of development at regional and national scales. We identify the characteristics of growth-inducing infrastructure and provide an overview of methods and policy that can facilitate a deliberate assessment of these keystone decisions.},

	abstract = {Roads and traffic affect animal populations detrimentally in four ways: they decrease habitat amount and quality, enhance mortality due to collisions with vehicles, prevent access to resources on the other side of the road, and subdivide animal populations into smaller and more vulnerable fractions. Roads will affect persistence of animal populations differently depending on (1) road avoidance behavior of the animals (i.e., noise avoidance, road surface avoidance, and car avoidance); (2) population sensitivity to the four road effects; (3) road size; and (4) traffic volume. We have created a model based on these population and road characteristics to study the questions: (1) what types of road avoidance behaviors make populations more vulnerable to roads?; (2) what types of roads have the greatest impact on population persistence?; and (3) how much does the impact of roads vary with the relative population sensitivity to the four road effects? Our results suggest that, in general, the most vulnerable populations are those with high noise and high road surface avoidance, and secondly, those with high noise avoidance only. Conversely, the least vulnerable populations are those with high car avoidance only, and secondly, high road surface and high car avoidance. Populations with low overall road avoidance and those with high overall road avoidance tend to respond in opposite ways when the sensitivity to the four road effects is varied. The same is true of populations with high road surface avoidance when compared to those with high car and high noise avoidance. The model further predicted that traffic volume has a larger effect than road size on the impact of roads on population persistence. One potential application of our model (to run the model on the web or to download it go to www.glel.carleton.ca/ or www.nls.ethz.ch/roadmodel/index.htm or contact the first author) is to generate predictions for more structured field studies of road avoidance behavior and its influence on persistence of wildlife populations.},

We evaluated five a priori hypotheses describing seasonal habitat selection of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788)) across three regions in northern Ontario. Two regions were Boreal Shield dominated, one area with relatively high anthropogenic disturbance (due to commercial forestry) and the other with relatively low anthropogenic disturbance. The final region was located on the wetland-dominated Hudson Bay Lowlands. Each region encompassed two caribou management ranges: one was used for model development and the other for model evaluation. We developed seasonal resource selection probability functions using seasonal utilization distributions and isopleths derived from GPS collar data (from 212 caribou) to identify high-and low-use areas. We explored selection across five spatial scales; selection patterns were strongest at the 10 000 ha scale. We found temporal and spatial variations in all environmental predictors across ranges and seasons, especially in the Hudson Bay Lowlands. Our results consistently supported the integrated global model (with common variables but range-specific coefficients) where caribou habitat use is related to minimizing apparent competition with moose (Alces alces (L., 1758)) while avoiding disturbed areas, and utilizing areas with adequate forage.},

	abstract = {Roads have numerous negative impacts for mammals, but may also serve as attractants due to altered vegetation or provisioning of resources. We reviewed the use of roads and their associated features by mammals, in order to understand the ecological factors contributing to road use. We documented 129 studies that recorded road use by 116 mammalian species, spanning 15 orders and 35 families, in six continents. Carnivora was the most common order (40 species, 34\% of all 116 species), followed by Artiodactyla (24 species, 20\%) and Rodentia (21 species, 18\%). The species were placed in the IUCN categories Least Concern (88 species, 76\% of all 116 species), Vulnerable (11 species, 9\%), Near Threatened (9 species, 8\%), Endangered (6 species, 5\%), and Critically Endangered (2 species, 2\%). We assigned road use to five ecological categories, reflecting the reason for it, with subcategories where appropriate: (1) communication; (2) foraging (subcategories: anthropogenic food, herbivory, predation, salt, scavenging, water); (3) movement (subcategories: bridges, environmental alterations, habitat connectivity); (4) refuge (subcategories: avoidance, burrowing and denning, cover, roosting); and (5) thermoregulation. Foraging, movement, and refuge were the most common uses. Roads provide a variety of resources to mammals, but road use is highly dynamic in time and space. We suggest that the use of roads by mammals is extensive, both geographically and taxonomically. Road use is likely to influence mammalian ecology while contributing to the risk of collisions with vehicles.},

	abstract = {1 The ecological footprint of a road may extend for several kilometres with overlapping effects from neighbouring roads causing a nonlinear accumulation of road effects in the landscape. Availability of preferred habitat, spatial dependencies between roads and habitat types, and fidelity to traditionally used areas further confound our ability to predict population-level responses of animals to growing road networks. 2 To isolate these effects, we developed an individually based movement model using elk Cervus elaphus L. as a model system. Empirically derived movement rules redistributed elk under different amounts of preferred habitat (clearcuts), road densities, and road development schemes. We tracked potential mortality risk (given time spent near roads) and emigration rates (given declining accessibility of foraging habitat). 3 Design of the road network accounted for up to 30–55\% difference in mortality risk and emigration rates, with the largest differences occurring at intermediate road densities (1–1·5 km km−2) when road effects began to saturate the landscape. Maintaining roads in association with clearcuts caused a decline in habitat accessibility equivalent to replacing 50–75\% of these foraging patches with conifer forest. A nine-fold difference in potential emigration was observed after varying elk tolerance for declining habitat accessibility despite holding local movement biases constant. 4 Elk responses to growing road networks were non-linear, exposing thresholds for road density that were reflected in the home range occupancy patterns of a large sample of elk in the region. 5 Synthesis and applications. Our approach provides a means of scaling-up complex movement decisions to population-level redistribution, separating the confounding effects of landscape context from road effects, and exposing thresholds in connectivity and mortality risks for wildlife caused by infrastructure growth. Our model indicated that road densities ≤ 0·5 km km−2 yielded the highest probability of elk occurrence where elk were hunted (and sensitive to roads), but disassociating roads from foraging habitats or managing human access to roads may maintain effective elk habitat at substantially higher road densities.},

We present a review and case study highlighting how study design limitations and publication bias have influenced our current knowledge on effects of human disturbance on Rangifer spp. Our case study illustrates how yearly variation may lead to false conclusions about the effects of infrastructure. From 58 analyses presented in 52 reviewed papers, we found that 14 analyses had study designs comparing area use before and after construction of infrastructure, 24 included spatial time series of {\textgreater} 6 years, 21 included spatiotemporal variation in their analyses, and only six contained both static and dynamic habitat variables. Categorizing the 58 analyses into 404 specific outcomes, we found that 64\% of the authors focused their conclusions on negative effects and 14\% focused on mixed effects but emphasized on negative effects of human activities and infrastructure, while only 53\% of the outcomes actually showed negative effects, 34\% no effects and 13\% positive effects. Our review shows that only one study had a before–after-control–impact (BACI) design, and a majority of publications do not include before–after (BA) designs (76\%), have not included spatiotemporal variation (64\%), and do not evaluate the effects of spatial fluctuations on Rangifer area use at long enough time intervals (only 8 studies had {\textgreater} 10 years data). Although Rangifer is vulnerable to human disturbances, we have showed how the effects of infrastructure differ among studies and highlight the need for study designs that integrate and account for spatiotemporal variation in future studies, for a better understanding of Rangifer (or wildlife) area use in relation to anthropogenic effects.},

	abstract = {Across the boreal forest of Canada, habitat disturbance is the ultimate cause of caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) declines. Habitat restoration is a focus of caribou recovery efforts, with a goal to finding ways to reduce predator use of disturbances, and caribou-predator encounters. One of the most pervasive disturbances within caribou ranges in Alberta, Canada are seismic lines cleared for energy exploration. Seismic lines facilitate predator movement, and although vegetation on some seismic lines is regenerating, it remains unknown whether vegetation regrowth is sufficient to alter predator response. We used Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, and GPS locations, to understand how vegetation and other attributes of seismic lines influence movements of two predators, wolves (Canis lupus) and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos). During winter, wolves moved towards seismic lines regardless of vegetation height, while during spring wolves moved towards seismic lines with higher vegetation. During summer, wolves moved towards seismic lines with lower vegetation and also moved faster near seismic lines with vegetation {\textless}0.7 m. Seismic lines with lower vegetation height were preferred by grizzly bears during spring and summer, but there was no relationship between vegetation height and grizzly bear movement rates. These results suggest that wolves use seismic lines for travel during summer, but during winter wolf movements relative to seismic lines could be influenced by factors additional to movement efficiency; potentially enhanced access to areas frequented by ungulate prey. Grizzly bears may be using seismic lines for movement, but could also be using seismic lines as a source of vegetative food or ungulate prey. To reduce wolf movement rate, restoration could focus on seismic lines with vegetation {\textless}1 m in height. However our results revealed that seismic lines continue to influence wolf movement behaviour decades after they were built, and even at later stages of regeneration. Therefore it remains unknown at what stage of natural regeneration, if any, wolves cease to respond to seismic lines. To reduce wolf response to seismic lines, active restoration tactics like blocking seismic lines and tree planting, along with management of alternate prey, could be evaluated.},

Road mortality is the largest single cause of death for many vertebrates, representing a growing phenomenon of remarkable dimension. Most studies in road ecology investigated spatial roadkill patterns, showing that roadkill probability is often higher near optimal habitat for a large amount of species. Landscape connectivity has been less often considered in roadkill research, and only few studies considered habitat suitability and landscape connectivity at the same time. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relative importance of habitat suitability and landscape connectivity in determining roadkill risk for a habitat-generalist carnivore, namely, the Eurasian badger in the Abruzzo region (Central Italy). We collected occurrence data of living individuals from camera trapping and roadkill data of through a Citizen Science initiative. We used the occurrence data to produce a habitat suitability model (HSM) and a landscape connectivity model (LCM). Both HSM and LCM were then used as predictors in combination with road characteristics to fit a roadkill risk model. We found that landscape connectivity was more important than habitat suitability in determining roadkill risk for the Eurasian badger. Overall, the density of regional roads was the most important variable. Our finding highlighted how important is to consider landscape connectivity in planning mitigation measures aimed to preserve habitat-generalist species.},

In the lower main valley, discrete bands of rams and ewes declined on 2 traditional winter ranges. The road and rail fatalities of Elk and sheep were superimposed on predation. In the late 1970s, wolves were estimated at 160, but reached an undetermined low in 2018 following year-round trapping on JNPs boundaries and accidental fatalities on the park's roads and railways.},

	abstract = {Movebank, a global platform for animal tracking and other animal-borne sensor data, is used by over 3,000 researchers globally to harmonize, archive and share nearly 3 billion animal occurrence records and more than 3 billion other animal-borne sensor measurements that document the movements and behavior of over 1,000 species. Movebank’s publicly described data model (Kranstauber et al. 2011), vocabulary and application programming interfaces (APIs) provide services for users to automate data import and retrieval. Near-live data feeds are maintained in cooperation with over 20 manufacturers of animal-borne sensors, who provide data in agreed-upon formats for accurate data import. Data acquisition by API complies with public or controlled-access sharing settings, defined within the database by data owners. The Environmental Data Automated Track Annotation System (EnvDATA, Dodge et al. 2013) allows users to link animal tracking data with hundreds of environmental parameters from remote sensing and weather reanalysis products through the Movebank website, and offers an API for advanced users to automate the submission of annotation requests. Movebank's mobile apps, the Animal Tracker and Animal Tagger, use APIs to support reporting and monitoring while in the field, as well as communication with citizen scientists. The recently-launched MoveApps platform connects with Movebank data using an API to allow users to build, execute and share repeatable workflows for data exploration and analysis through a user-friendly interface. A new API, currently under development, will allow calls to retrieve data from Movebank reduced according to criteria defined by "reduction profiles", which can greatly reduce the volume of data transferred for many use cases.
In addition to making this core set of Movebank services possible, Movebank's APIs enable the development of external applications, including the widely used R programming packages 'move' (Kranstauber et al. 2012) and 'ctmm' (Calabrese et al. 2016), and user-specific workflows to efficiently execute collaborative analyses and automate tasks such as syncing with local organizational and governmental websites and archives. The APIs also support large-scale data acquisition, including for projects under development to visualize, map and analyze bird migrations led by the British Trust for Ornithology, the coordinating organisation for European bird ringing (banding) schemes (EURING), Georgetown University, National Audubon Society, Smithsonian Institution and United Nations Convention on Migratory Species.
Our API development is constrained by a lack of standardization in data reporting across animal-borne sensors and a need to ensure adequate communication with data users (e.g., how to properly interpret data; expectations for use and attribution) and data owners (e.g., who is using publicly-available data and how) when allowing automated data access. As interest in data linking, harvesting, mirroring and integration grows, we recognize needs to coordinate API development across animal tracking and biodiversity databases, and to develop a shared system for unique organism identifiers. Such a system would allow linking of information about individual animals within and across repositories and publications in order to recognize data for the same individuals across platforms, retain provenance and attribution information, and ensure beneficial and biologically meaningful data use.},

	abstract = {In an effort to ensure the sustainability of their forests, boreal forest managers often use forest planning models to make future projections of timber supply and other key services, such as habitat for wildlife. Projecting the fate of these services has proven to be challenging, however, as major uncertainties exist regarding the principal drivers of boreal ecosystem dynamics, including the future spatial and temporal distribution of wildfire and timber harvesting. Existing forest planning models are not well suited to dealing with this uncertainty because they produce deterministic projections based on central tendencies of these drivers. Here we present a new approach for incorporating uncertainty into forest management planning, which we demonstrate using two landscapes in the Canadian boreal forest. Our approach takes the assumptions contained within the latest forest management plans for each of these landscapes, including parameterizations of their deterministic forest planning models, and converts these assumptions into equivalent parameterizations of a stochastic, spatially-explicit state-and-transition simulation model (STSM). We then use Monte Carlo simulations with the STSM to “stress-test\{”\} the forest management plan with respect to a range of possible future uncertainties, including uncertainties in future levels and patterns of wildfire and timber harvest, along with the possible changes in wildfire that might result from future climate change. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of incorporating stochastic variability into projections of future ecosystem condition. The STSM projections that acknowledged variability in wildfire and timber harvest differed from the deterministic forest planning model projections that were based solely on mean values. Our analysis also suggests that there is an increased risk of shortfalls in timber harvest, for both boreal landscapes, associated with future projections for changes in wildfire due to climate change, and that management strategies aimed at reducing the future level of timber harvest offer an opportunity to mitigate these risks. We believe our approach provides a new risk-based framework for incorporating uncertainty into forest management, including the effects of climate change. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Barrier effect is a road-related impact affecting several animal populations. It can be caused by behavioural responses towards roads (surface and/or gap avoidance), associated emissions (traffic-emissions avoidance) and/or circulating vehicles (vehicle avoidance). Most studies so far have described road-effect zones along major roads, without determining the actual factor inducing the behavioural response. The purpose of the present study was to assess the factors potentially causing road-effect zones in a heterogeneous road network (with variations in road width, road surface and traffic volume) and eventually to estimate the reduction of habitat quality imposed by roads within a protected area (Doñana Biosphere Reserve, Spain). As model species, we used two ungulates, red deer Cervus elaphus and wild boar Sus scrofa. We surveyed the presence of both species along 200-m transects. All transects started and were perpendicular to reference roads (those with a traffic volume above 10 cars per day), often intersecting unpaved minor roads with virtually no traffic. The presence probability of both species was mainly affected by the distance to the nearest road (in most cases unpaved roads without traffic), but also by the proximity to reference roads. Red deer presence was also affected by the traffic volume of the nearest reference road. At a regional scale, the overall road network within the protected area imposes a reduction in presence probability of 40\% for red deer and 55\% for wild boar. A road network optimization, decommissioning unused and unpaved roads, would re-establish almost entirely the potential habitat quality (91\% for both species). Synthesis and applications. We found that both study species avoided roads regardless of their surface or traffic volume, suggesting a response due to gap avoidance which may be based on the association between linear infrastructures and the possibility of vehicles occurring along them. The overall behavioural response can substantially decrease habitat quality over large scales, including the conservation value of protected areas. For this reason, we recommend road network optimization by road decommissioning to mitigate the impact of roads at a regional scale, with potential positive effects at ecosystem level.},

We examined the potential increase in land-cover types, elevation representation and landscape connectivity that inventoried roadless areas would provide in a northern Rockies (USA) conservation reserve strategy, if these roadless areas received full protection. 2 For the northern Rocky Mountain states of Montana, Wyoming and Idaho, USA, we obtained GIS data on land-cover types and a digital elevation model. We calculated the percentage of land-cover types and elevation ranges of current protected areas (wilderness, national parks and national wildlife refuges) and compared these with the percentages calculated for roadless and protected areas combined. Using five landscape metrics and corresponding statistics, we quantified how roadless areas, when assessed with current protected areas, affect three elements of landscape connectivity: area, isolation and aggregation. 3 Roadless areas, when added to existing federal-protected areas in the northern Rockies, increase the representation of virtually all land-cover types, some by more than 100\%, and increase the protection of relatively undisturbed lower elevation lands, which are exceedingly rare in the northern Rockies. In fact, roadless areas protect more rare and declining land-cover types, such as aspen, whitebark pine, sagebrush and grassland communities, than existing protected areas. 4 Synthesis and applications. Landscape metric results for the three elements of landscape connectivity (area, isolation and aggregation) demonstrate how roadless areas adjacent to protected areas increase connectivity by creating larger and more cohesive protected area ‘patches.’ Roadless areas enhance overall landscape connectivity by reducing isolation among protected areas and creating a more dispersed conservation reserve network, important for maintaining wide-ranging species movements. We advocate that the USDA Forest Service should retain the Roadless Area Conservation Rule and manage roadless areas as an integral part of the conservation reserve network for the northern Rockies.},

	abstract = {Many caribou populations in Canada face extirpation despite dozens of provincial and federal legislative instruments designed to protect them. How are industrial developments that impact caribou justified and permitted despite governments' commitments to caribou protection? Toward an answer, this paper scrutinizes an approval process for major projects in Canada: environmental assessment (EA). We identify 65 EAs for major projects with potentially significant adverse impacts for caribou—all projects but one were approved. The results show that most projects were approved on the basis of proposed mitigation measures that promise to render adverse effects “insignificant”; yet mitigation effectiveness is largely unknown. Further, several projects were approved even though mitigation measures were insufficient, citing public or national interest. Finally, some projects' approval rested in part on scientific claims that the project area is already degraded or absent of caribou. Based on these findings, EA is failing caribou, acting as a means by which the state licenses major developments with potentially significant adverse effects for caribou, with a pretense of protection. The failure stems in part from a broader tension within the state that manifests in EA: a tension between the state's roles promoting economic growth and protecting against this growth's negative effects. Recognition of this tension needs to be more central to conservation biology.},

	abstract = {Road networks form the basic transportation system for most of the world's inhabitants, stimulating local and regional economies. Scientific advances in recent years have revealed that this vast, growing, planetary construction boom has been occurring mostly in non-urban environments, and most aggressively in developing frontiers of tropical regions. However, even in highly urbanized countries, road networks consist mostly of roads outside of urban areas. To produce a reliable, comprehensive picture of the global road network, scientists have taken advantage of improvements in mapping technologies, including automated detection from satellite imagery and real-time mapping on the ground. Because the extent of the global road network is increasing at a rapid, unprecedented pace, the pervasive and sometimes dramatic impacts on ecosystems and their services in rural areas will continue. The science of road ecology has emerged to quantify these effects and propose solutions to mitigate the detrimental effects of roads and their traffic. This report explains these effects and examines implications of road ecology research for decisions and actions, including some management practices to help mitigate the negative ecological effects of rural roads. Some of the major ecological effects of roads in rural landscapes include: • Destruction of habitat, including fragmentation of plant and animal populations. • Traffic disturbance, including animal-vehicle collisions that reduce populations and/or habitat quality to the point of causing local extinctions. • Introduction and establishment of invasive and non-native plants and animals that compete with native flora and fauna. • Pollutants, including hydrocarbons, salts, nitrates, heavy metals, and pesticides, emitted from vehicles, road surface materials, and associated with dust. These pollutants persist in and change the roadside environment, including aquatic habitats (e.g., near-road streams) and downstream aquatic systems (e.g., estuaries). • Alteration of hydrology: ditches change water movement and infiltration patterns; road structures affect erosion and sedimentation of streambeds; culverts fragment streams altering movement of aquatic fauna. • Increased access to remote places that, in turn, enables the collateral destruction of habitats, the degradation of ecosystems, and the loss of biodiversity. Several strategies exist for mitigating the negative effects of roads in rural landscapes. Road ecology can be applied advantageously in transportation policy, planning, and decision making to reduce the impacts of roads by evaluating development alternatives, including whether to build a road, where to build, as well as how and when to build. Such strategies can be applied at continental, regional, or local scales, contributing to the discussion of tradeoffs within a framework of sustainable development. Strategies for mitigating environmental impacts include configuring roads to avoid destroying ecosystems, installing fences to reduce road mortality, creating safe passages for wildlife under and over roads, controlling traffic during critical times for key species, and following best practices for road construction and maintenance.},

	abstract = {Human-dominated landscapes are being recolonized by large carnivores, thereby increasing conflicts worldwide via predation of livestock and harvested wildlife such as ungulates. Recent meta-analyses have shown that predator control (hereafter, predator removal) has mixed success in reducing livestock predation. Yet, it is unknown how effective predator removal is in decreasing predation on ungulates due to a lack of quantitative synthesis, despite the long history of implementation in North America. We quantified the demographic responses of ungulate survival and recruitment rates, abundance, and population growth to experimental predator removal and identified the ecological and experimental design factors affecting ungulate responses to predator removal. We conducted a literature review of management and natural experiments to increase ungulate demography finding 52 predator removal experiments and 10 natural experiments from 47 publications. We then conducted a meta-analysis to determine the overall effect size and factors which increased ungulate demography during predator removal. Lastly, we tested for evidence of publication bias and experimental rigour for these experiments. We found that predator removal in both management and natural experiments increased ungulate demographic responses by 13\% (95\% CI = 4.1\%–23\%), yet prediction intervals overlapped with 0 (95\% PI = −34\% to 93\%). Focusing just on management removals, ungulate demographic responses increased only by 7.8\% (95\% PI = −32\% to 72\%), indicating that future experiments could have negligible effects. Predator removal in both management and natural experiments was more successful in improving the demography of young (e.g. recruitment ES = 44\%, 95\% CI = 13\%–83\%) but equivocal in improving adult survival (ES = 5.4\%, 95\% CI = −18\% to 36\%) and ungulate abundance (ES = 13\%, 95\% CI = −17\% to 31\%). The low and variable effectiveness of predator removal for ungulate populations might be linked to ungulates' slow life history and the compensatory mortality of carnivores on ungulates, though effects were stronger on endangered prey. We identified the experimental design factors that led to greater uncertainty in ungulate responses to predator removal, including lack of randomization, low replication and short temporal length. Lastly, we found evidence of publication bias, where experiments with poor rigour and negative effects (i.e. reduced ungulate demography following predator removal) were under-reported. Synthesis and Applications. We recommend future predator removal experiments be conducted with a more rigorous experimental design to overcome these weaknesses, especially for endangered species where predator removal may work more effectively. We suggest that managers attempting to evaluate experimental practices to increase ungulate populations through predator removal could employ an open standards framework akin to the ‘Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation’ framework.},

	abstract = {The mitigation of road-effects on wildlife, especially road mortality and habitat fragmentation, has become increasingly common in the last 20 years. However, exclusion fencing and habitat connectivity structures can be very costly and several questions remain regarding how to best determine locations that will optimize mitigation success. Based on data collected across several years and across multiple landscapes and taxa, we present a comparative analysis of two methods: road surveys and circuit theory, and review their benefits and challenges to better inform decision making. Road surveys were completed in two locations over three years for large mammals and herpetofauna to identify road crossing hotspots. Circuit theory was also applied to these systems to identify crossing hotspots using habitat resistance models. The location, number and width of hotspots were compared between methods. Hotspot distributions were similar between methods for some herpetofauna, but different for Mammals, and road surveys produced a significantly greater number of smaller hotspots compared to circuit theory, implying that road surveys provide better hotspot resolution. As circuit model complexity increased, the number and width of hotspots decreased, diffusing across the landscape. Road surveys were better at predicting optimal crossing structure location at a local scale; however, circuit theory is less costly, and can be useful at large scales. As both methods can offer valuable information, we argue that the combination of these two approaches provides a strong basis for managers and biologists to make informed decisions about costly mitigation measures, optimizing both conservation benefits and limited funding.},

	abstract = {Migration occurs over a relatively short time period, but can result in an increased likelihood of mortality. Many populations of Southern Mountain Caribou, an Endangered subspecies in Canada, demonstrate altitudinal migration when moving between alpine and subalpine ranges. These caribou can encounter a high density of predators when transiting low- or mid-elevation valleys. We used camera traps to document the movements of caribou as well as moose, a sympatric ungulate that enhances the distribution and abundance of shared predators, through a mid-elevation valley that was characterized by resource roads and forestry clearcuts. The seasonal occurrence of moose coincided with the migratory movements of caribou (June–September). Similarly, the relative abundance of wolves and bears was greatest when caribou occupied the corridor. We used logistic regression to relate camera images to a range of ecological variables that we hypothesized influenced the seasonal distribution and risk of predation for moose and caribou. The most predictive model suggested that the probability of occurrence of caribou increased with temperature, precipitation, and week of the year. A factor for year revealed that the occurrence of caribou declined over the monitoring period. The most parsimonious model for moose included the same covariates as the most predictive model for caribou. A comparison of the frequency of caribou images with those crossings inferred from GPS-collar data revealed that the camera traps were relatively ineffective at monitoring the migratory movements of caribou. This study provided unique insights into the migration of a declining population of caribou, their interactions with predators, and the limitations of using camera traps to document the infrequent movements of low-density species.},

	abstract = {Impediments to animal movement are ubiquitous and vary widely in both scale and permeability. It is essential to understand how impediments alter ecological dynamics via their influence on animal behavioural strategies governing space use and, for anthropogenic features such as roads and fences, how to mitigate these effects to effectively manage species and landscapes. Here, we focused primarily on barriers to movement, which we define as features that cannot be circumnavigated but may be crossed. Responses to barriers will be influenced by the movement capabilities of the animal, its proximity to the barriers, and habitat preference. We developed a mechanistic modelling framework for simultaneously quantifying the permeability and proximity effects of barriers on habitat preference and movement. We used simulations based on our model to demonstrate how parameters on movement, habitat preference and barrier permeability can be estimated statistically. We then applied the model to a case study of road effects on wild mountain reindeer summer movements. This framework provided unbiased and precise parameter estimates across a range of strengths of preferences and barrier permeabilities. The quality of permeability estimates, however, was correlated with the number of times the barrier is crossed and the number of locations in proximity to barriers. In the case study we found that reindeer avoided areas near roads and that roads are semi-permeable barriers to movement. There was strong avoidance of roads extending up to c. 1 km for four of five animals, and having to cross roads reduced the probability of movement by 68·6\% (range 3·5–99·5\%). Human infrastructure has embedded within it the idea of networks: nodes connected by linear features such as roads, rail tracks, pipelines, fences and cables, many of which divide the landscape and limit animal movement. The unintended but potentially profound consequences of infrastructure on animals remain poorly understood. The rigorous framework for simultaneously quantifying movement, habitat preference and barrier permeability developed here begins to address this knowledge gap.},

	abstract = {Although prey species typically respond to the most limiting factors at coarse spatiotemporal scales while addressing biological requirements at finer scales, such behaviour may become challenging for species inhabiting human altered landscapes. We investigated how woodland caribou, a threatened species inhabiting North-American boreal forests, modified their fine-scale movements when confronted with forest management features (i.e. clearcuts and roads). We used GPS telemetry data collected between 2004 and 2010 on 49 female caribou in a managed area in Québec, Canada. Movements were studied using a use – availability design contrasting observed steps (i.e. line connecting two consecutive locations) with random steps (i.e. proxy of immediate habitat availability). Although caribou mostly avoided disturbances, individuals nonetheless modulated their fine-scale response to disturbances on a daily and annual basis, potentially compromising between risk avoidance in periods of higher vulnerability (i.e. calving, early and late winter) during the day and foraging activities in periods of higher energy requirements (i.e. spring, summer and rut) during dusk/dawn and at night. The local context in which females moved was shown to influence their decision to cross clearcut edges and roads. Indeed, although females typically avoided crossing clearcut edges and roads at low densities, crossing rates were found to rapidly increase in greater disturbance densities. In some instance, however, females were less likely to cross edges and roads as densities increased. Females may then be trapped and forced to use disturbed habitats, known to be associated with higher predation risk. We believe that further increases in anthropogenic disturbances could exacerbate such behavioural responses and ultimately lead to population level consequences.},

We coupled a spatially explicit individual-based movement model with a range of landscape scenarios to assess the impacts of varying degrees of climate change, and the ability of conservation actions to compensate for such impacts on caribou movement behaviors. We found that (1) climate change impacts reduced movement potential, and that (2) the complete restoration of secondary roads inside protected areas was able to fully offset this reduction, suggesting that road restoration would be an effective compensatory conservation action.

However, it is unknown whether personality traits or behavioural syndromes might change as a consequence of dispersal itself. We analysed 14 GPS-collared grey wolves, Canis lupus, in Finland that dispersed from their natal territories and settled in new territories, as well as 22 time-matched nondispersing controls. We used wolf avoidance of low-use forest roads, high-use primary roads and houses as proxies for boldness, and we estimated wolf responses to these features across spatial scales and across dispersal phases. Wolves, which already occupy portions of Finland with low human density, expanded into more human-impacted areas, but with a strong large-scale selection for relatively low human presence. At the finer scale, avoidance of human elements varied as a function of dispersal phase. During dispersal, avoidance of forest roads, primary roads and houses was substantially lower than in natal territories, reflecting the need to take more risks while moving in a small group (alone or with a single mate) in unfamiliar environments. After settling in new territories, the strength of avoidance of those elements continued to be lower than in natal territories, even after controlling for changes in availability. These results suggest that experiences gained across a major life-history transition, such as dispersal, might themselves influence personality traits.},

	abstract = {Mountain caribou are an endangered ecotype of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) that historically occurred throughout the high snowfall regions of southeast British Columbia and the northwestern United States. The decline in caribou is thought to be due to apparent competition where increases in early-seral conditions stimulate a numerical response in primary ungulate prey and their predators and these incidentally kill an unsustainable number of caribou. Based on the known location of death of 207 radio collared animals, we tested hypotheses pertaining to relationships between landscape composition and predator-specific mortality of mountain caribou at 2 ecologically based spatial scales. Relative to landscape conditions within subpopulation boundaries (level 1) or within home ranges (level 2), caribou were at greater risk of predation at low elevations particularly within otherwise complex terrain (i.e., valleys) with more variation in overstory canopy closure and greater road densities. Caribou vulnerability to bears was also positively related to the variation in overstory age. Cougar predation was not related to roads or terrain complexity but occurred more often in landscapes with warmer aspects and greater proportions of stands of {\textless}120 years. Wolf predation occurred primarily at low elevations at the broader scale and in association with roads at the finer scale. Our results indicate that caribou vulnerability to predation was a function of both static (e.g., terrain) and dynamic (e.g., overstory conditions) factors, but we did not find evidence that localized habitat fragmentation due to forest harvest influenced predation on caribou. This result is not inconsistent with the apparent competition hypothesis but suggests that habitat change largely functions at broader spatial scales involving landscapes that can be beyond those occupied by caribou, including the winter ranges of primary ungulate prey. These changes and the season-dependent dispersion of other ungulates and their predators may largely influence mortality risk to mountain caribou. Although roads and forest fragmentation are interrelated, roads may further contribute to caribou predation by increasing the efficiency of movement of some predators and thereby increasing encounter rates with caribou. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {Mountain caribou, an ecotype of woodland caribou, are endangered due to the loss and fragmentation of old forests on which they depend. However, a wider array of natural and human factors may limit caribou persistence and isolate populations, and understanding these may help to stop or reverse population declines by forecasting risk and targeting core habitat areas and key linkages for protection, enhancement or restoration. Across most of the historic range of mountain caribou, we conducted a bi-level analysis to evaluate factors related to the persistence of, and landscape occupancy within, remaining subpopulations. We used caribou location data from 235 radio-collared animals across 13 subpopulations to derive a landscape occupancy index, while accounting for inherent sampling biases. We analyzed this index against 33 landscape variables of forest overstory, land cover, terrain, climate, and human influence. At the metapopulation level, the persistence of subpopulations relative to historic range was explained by the extent of wet and very wet climatic conditions, the distribution of both old ({\textgreater}140yr) forests, particularly of cedar and hemlock composition, and alpine areas. Other important factors were remoteness from human presence, low road density, and little motorized access. At the subpopulation level, the relative intensity of caribou landscape occupancy within subpopulation bounds was explained by the distribution of old cedar/hemlock and spruce/subalpine fir forests and the lack of deciduous forests. Other factors impeding population contiguity were icefields, non-forested alpine, hydro reservoirs, extensive road networks, and primary highway routes. Model outputs at both levels were combined to predict the potential for mountain caribou population persistence, isolation, and restoration. We combined this output with the original occupancy index to gauge the potential vulnerability of caribou to extirpation within landscapes known to have recently supported animals. We discuss implications as they pertain to range-wide caribou population connectivity and conservation.},

	abstract = {Changes in hydrological characteristics and increases in various pollutant loadings due to rapid climate change and urbanization have a significant impact on the deterioration of aquatic ecosystem health (AEH). Therefore, it is important to effectively evaluate the AEH in advance and establish appropriate strategic plans. Recently, machine learning (ML) models have been widely used to solve hydrological and environmental problems in various fields. However, in general, collecting sufficient data for ML training is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Especially in classification problems, data imbalance can lead to erroneous prediction results of ML models. In this study, we proposed a method to solve the data imbalance problem through data augmentation based on Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) and to efficiently predict the grades (from A to E grades) of AEH indices (i.e., Benthic Macroinvertebrate Index (BMI), Trophic Diatom Index (TDI), Fish Assessment Index (FAI)) through the ML models. Raw datasets for the AEH indices composed of various physicochemical factors (i.e., WT, DO, BOD5, SS, TN, TP, and Flow) and AEH grades were built and augmented through the WGAN. The performance of each ML model was evaluated through a 10-fold cross-validation (CV), and the performances of the ML models trained on the raw and WGAN-based training sets were compared and analyzed through AEH grade prediction on the test sets. The results showed that the ML models trained on the WGAN-based training set had an average F1-score for grades of each AEH index of 0.9 or greater for the test set, which was superior to the models trained on the raw training set (fewer data compared to other datasets) only. Through the above results, it was confirmed that by using the dataset augmented through WGAN, the ML model can yield better AEH grade predictive performance compared to the model trained on limited datasets; this approach reduces the effort needed for actual data collection from rivers which requires enormous time and cost. In the future, the results of this study can be used as basic data to construct big data of aquatic ecosystems, needed to efficiently evaluate and predict AEH in rivers based on the ML models.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT 1. This paper reviews and compares the effects of forest ﬁre and timber harvest on mammalian abundance and diversity, throughout successional time in the boreal forest of North America. 2. Temporal trends in mammal abundance and diversity are generally similar for both harvested and burned stands, with some differences occurring in the initiation stage (0–10 years post disturbance). 3. Small mammals and ungulates are most abundant immediately post disturbance, and decrease as stands age. Lynxes and hares utilize mid-successional stands, but are rare in young and old stands. Bats, arboreal sciurids and mustelids increase in abundance with stand age, and are most abundant in old growth. 4. Substantial gaps in the data exist for carnivores; the response of these species to ﬁre and harvest requires research, as predator–prey interactions can affect mammal community structure in both early and late successional stages. 5. The lack of explicit treatment of in-stand forest structure post disturbance, in the reviewed literature made comparisons difﬁcult. Where forest structure was considered, the presence of downed woody material, live residual trees and standing dead wood were shown to facilitate convergence of mammal communities to a pre-disturbance state for both disturbance types. 6. Mammalian assemblages differed considerably between successional stages, emphasizing the importance of maintaining stands of each successional stage on the landscape when implementing forest management strategies.},

We used meta-analyses to study the effects of infrastructure proximity on mammal and bird populations. Data were gathered from 49 studies on 234 mammal and bird species. The main response by mammals and birds in the vicinity of infrastructure was either avoidance or a reduced population density. The mean species abundance, relative to non-disturbed distances (MSA), was used as the effect size measure. The impact of infrastructure distance on MSA was studied using meta-analyses. Possible sources of heterogeneity in the results of the meta-analysis were explored with meta-regression. Mammal and bird population densities declined with their proximity to infrastructure. The effect of infrastructure on bird populations extended over distances up to about 1km, and for mammal populations up to about 5km. Mammals and birds seemed to avoid infrastructure in open areas over larger distances compared to forested areas, which could be related to the reduced visibility of the infrastructure in forested areas. We did not find a significant effect of traffic intensity on the MSA of birds. Species varied in their response to infrastructure. Raptors were found to be more abundant in the proximity of infrastructure whereas other bird taxa tended to avoid it. Abundances were affected at variable distances from infrastructure: within a few meters for small-sized mammals and up to several hundred meters for large-sized mammals. Our findings show the importance of minimizing infrastructure development for wildlife conservation in relatively undisturbed areas. By combining actual species distributions with the effect distance functions we developed, regions sensitive to infrastructure development may be identified. Additionally, the effect distance functions can be used in models in support of decision making on infrastructure planning.},

In CA modelling complex patterns emerge on a global scale through the evolution of interactions at a local level. Although the validity of a cell-based approach has successfully been demonstrated in numerous cases, very few studies have been reported that address the eﬀects of cell size and conﬁguration on the behaviours of CA-based models. In this paper, the performance of a cellular automaton based prey–predator model (EcoCA) developed by the author was ﬁrst calibrated against the classical Lotka–Volterra (LV) model. The model was then used to investigate eﬀects of cell size and cellular conﬁgurations (viz. the Ôcomputational stencil’). By setting up systematic simulation scenarios it was observed that the choice of a particular cell size has a clear eﬀect on the resulting spatial patterns, while diﬀerent cellular conﬁgurations aﬀect both spatial patterns and system stability. On the basis of these ﬁndings, it is proposed to use the principal spatial scale of the studied ecosystem as CA model cell size and to apply the Moore type cell conﬁguration. Methods for identifying principal spatial scales have been developed and are presented here.},

	abstract = {Quantification of Land-Use and Land-Cover (LULC) changes associated with energy extraction footprints plays an important role in reclamation performance assessment, compliance monitoring, and sustainable land manage­ ment practices. For regulatory planning and decision making purposes, it is crucial to understand the types and representation of disturbance present on the landscape related to energy footprints (i.e., oil, gas, and coal mining activities), non-energy footprints (i.e., other infrastructure), cutblocks, and wildfire. In this study, Landsat multispectral datasets were analysed using advanced classification and unmixing algorithms to calculate LULC changes associated with these disturbance agents from 1985 to 2015 in the Upper Peace Region, one of the major oil and gas exploration sites in Alberta, Canada. Based on 5-year intervals throughout this 30-year study, seven epochal LULC maps and a cumulative land disturbance map were produced with 82 \% and 89 \% overall accu­ racies, respectively, based on extensive and multisource, independent validation. Assessment of multiple disturbance regimes and time-series trajectories with high accuracies in this complex environment was vital to document and quantify disturbance, vegetation re-establishment, succession, and reclamation. Results indicate that more than 60 \% forest loss (coniferous and deciduous) occurred due to harvesting and less than 20 \% forest loss occurred due to energy and non-energy footprints. An assessment of the current state showed 40–60 \% of cutblocks and burned areas returned as immature forest and wetland and 15–20 \% recovered to forest, ac­ counting for successional processes that take time for the re-establishment of trees following disturbance. Out of total energy footprints, 8 \% recovered as shrubland and 16 \% recovered as forest, with almost no sign of vegetation recovery evident in non-energy footprints (e.g., urban and long term industrial land use). The highest area of land disturbance (3412 km2) was over coniferous forest with 5-year disturbance areas of 55 km2, 65 km2, 70 km2, and 295 km2, associated with, respectively, wildfire, energy development, non-energy footprints, and harvesting. This type of LULC investigation informs land-use threshold management for energy footprints by identifying and partitioning key disturbance agents into land use. Knowledge of change type and land use enables insights on long term implications of the changes present and serves to guide sustainable development, envi­ ronmental protection, and informing forward looking land use future state simulations.},

	abstract = {Natural resource management professionals require adaptable spatial tools for conserving and managing wildlife across landscapes. These tools should integrate multiple components of habitat quality and incorporate local disturbance regimes. We provide a spatial modeling framework that integrates three components of habitat (nutritional resources, connectivity, and predation risk) into indices of habitat quality under a simulated wildﬁre disturbance regime. Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), a species of conservation concern, is used to illustrate our framework. We simulated disturbance from wildﬁre on two boreal forest landscapes to produce stand ages, from which we computed and integrated the three habitat indicator components using different schemes. Spatial variation in the inﬂuence of wildﬁre and the distribution of the three components of habitat resulted in heterogeneous patterns of habitat quality. The inclusion of disturbance led to a different habitat quality landscape than that of a static model in which the inﬂuence of wildﬁre on vegetation communities was not considered, incorporating the likelihood of persistence into the overall representation of habitat quality. The integration of nutrition, connectivity, and predation risk into a single index of habitat quality produced spatial patterns distinct from maps of the individual components. Regardless of whether the components were combined through additive, multiplicative, or minimum habitat quality threshold methods, areas of very high- and poor-quality habitat were found at consistent locations across the landscape, suggesting that these two types of regions provide opportunities for long-term management interventions. The framework presented here is adaptable and modular; it could be modiﬁed and applied to other species, regions, and disturbance regimes. It provides a nuanced representation of persistent habitat and has the potential to be a useful tool for conservation planning.},

	abstract = {Road ecology has developed into a significant branch of ecology with steady growth in the number of refereed journal articles, books, conferences, symposia, and “best practice” guidelines being produced each year. The main objective of this special issue of Ecology and Society is to highlight the need for studies that document the population, community, and ecosystem-level effects of roads and traffic by publishing studies that document these effects. It became apparent when compiling this special issue that there is a paucity of studies that explicitly examined higher order effects of roads and traffic. No papers on landscape function or ecosystem-level effects were submitted, despite being highlighted as a priority for publication. The 17 papers in this issue, from Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, and USA, all deal to some extent with either population or community-level effects of roads and traffic. Nevertheless, many higher order effects remain unquantified, and must become the focus of future studies because the complexity and interactions among the effects of roads and traffic are large and potentially unexpected. An analysis of these complex interrelations requires systematic research, and it is necessary to further establish collaborative links between ecologists and transportation agencies. Many road agencies have “environmental sustainability” as one of their goals and the only way to achieve such goals is for them to support and foster long-term and credible scientific research. The current situation, with numerous smallscale projects being undertaken independently of each other, cannot provide the information required to quantify and mitigate the negative effects of roads and traffic on higher levels. The future of road ecology research will be best enhanced when multiple road projects in different states or countries are combined and studied as part of integrated, well-replicated research projects.},

	abstract = {Distributions of landbirds in Canadian northern forests are expected to be affected by climate change, but it remains unclear which pathways are responsible for projected climate effects. Determining whether climate change acts indirectly through changing fire regimes and/or vegetation dynamics, or directly through changes in climatic suitability may allow land managers to address negative trajectories via forest management. We used SpaDES, a novel toolkit built in R that facilitates the implementation of simulation models from different areas of knowledge to develop a simulation experiment for a study area comprising 50 million ha in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Our factorial experiment was designed to contrast climate effects pathways on 64 landbird species using climate-sensitive and non-climate sensitive models for tree growth and mortality, wildfire, and landbirds. Climate-change effects were predicted to increase suitable habitat for 73\% of species, resulting in average net gain of 7.49 million ha across species. We observed higher species turnover in the northeastern, south-central (species loss), and western regions (species gain). Importantly, we found that most of the predicted differences in net area of occupancy across models were attributed to direct climate effects rather than simulated vegetation change, despite a similar relative importance of vegetation and climate variables in landbird models. Even with close to a doubling of annual area burned by 2100, and a 600 kg/ha increase in aboveground tree biomass predicted in this region, differences in landbird net occupancy across models attributed to climate-driven forest growth were very small, likely resulting from differences in the pace of vegetation and climate changes, or vegetation lags. The effect of vegetation lags (i.e., differences from climatic equilibrium) varied across species, resulting in a wide range of changes in landbird distribution, and consequently predicted occupancy, due to climate effects. These findings suggest that hybrid approaches using statistical models and landscape simulation tools could improve wildlife forecasts when future uncoupling of vegetation and climate is anticipated. This study lays some of the methodological groundwork for ecological adaptive management using the new platform SpaDES, which allows for iterative forecasting, mixing of modeling paradigms, and tightening connections between data, parameterization, and simulation.},

	abstract = {The integrated harvest-scheduling model addresses the tactical forest management planning problem of maximizing harvest revenues minus road construction and transportation costs. This paper considers the problem of developing innovations to this model such that it can: (1) be used to generate solutions to problem instances containing a large set of candidate roads, with many circuits; (2) yield improved solutions when compared to prior formulations; and (3) achieve improvements in the solutions by reducing the total construction and transportation costs. To the end, a new formulation of the integrated model was developed using the following strategy: (a) each candidate road was represented in the model by two directed arcs (instead of one undirected edge, as used in prior formulations); and (b) a set of strengthening constraints including clique constraint was developed to exploit the property of the directness of the candidate roads. The new model was tested and compared with prior formulations on eight problem instances, ranging in size from 900 to 4900 stands and containing candidate roads ranging in number from 3424 to 19,184. Results show that the new formulation: (1) entails the use of larger set of constraints than prior formulations; (2) produced tighter root-LP gaps, than prior models, as the problem instances grew in size and complexity; and (3) produced solutions with the tightest relative gap, the highest objective function value, and major reductions in the cost of constructing a road network, as the problem instances grew in size and complexity. Our conclusion is that the strategy of formulating the integrated model, used in this paper, may be useful to future researchers and practitioners working on this problem.},

	abstract = {Managing forests for sustainable use requires that both the biological diversity of the forests and a viable forest industry be maintained. A current approach towards maintaining biological diversity is to pattern forest management practices after those of natural disturbance events. This paradigm hypothesizes that ecological processes will be maintained best where active management approximates natural disturbance events. The forest management model now used in most sub-boreal and boreal forests calls for regularly dispersed clearcuts no greater than 60–100 ha in size. However, the spatial characteristics of the landscape produced by this model are distinctly different from the historic pattern generated by wildfire, which was heretofore the dominant stand-replacing process in these forests. Wildfire creates a more complex landscape spatial pattern with greater range in patch size and more irregular disturbance boundaries. Individual wildfires are often over 500 ha but leave patches of unburned forest within them. The combination of these attributes is not present in recent clearcuts. Allowing a proportion of larger (i.e.{\textgreater}500ha) harvest units may provide distinct economic advantages that could outweight the opportunity costs of leaving some patches of forest behind. For the forest type examined, further evaluation of modelling forest harvest patterns more closely after the patterns created by wildfire is required as it may achieve a good balance and strike a suitable compromise between certain ecological and economic objectives of sustainable development.},

An old forest (\&gt;100 years) maintenance target was established considering the range of historical variability in the proportion of this forest stage. However, the estimation of the harvesting rate that maintains the target level in old forests did not consider explicitly the impact of current and future, i.e. possibly higher, fire frequency. In this context, we compared historical, current, and future age structures according to recorded or projected fire activity and the current level of harvesting in western Quebec's boreal forest. Results show that under the current rates of harvesting and fire, the proportion of old forests could reach a minimum level rarely seen in the natural landscape in the past. The situation could become even more critical with the projected increase in fire activity under climate change. Numerous forest and fire management solutions exist, such as increasing rotation length, implementing a diversified silviculture, using a fire-smart approach or reaching a better balance between intensive management and conservation. We advocate their rapid implementation to reverse the projected decrease in the proportion of old forests.},

Positioning primary extraction routes is crucial in these efforts, as it has a huge impact on efﬁcient and sustainable forwarder passages. To minimize the total forwarding distance and avoid steep terrain and impact on soil and water, we developed a decision support system, including a detailed optimization model and solution method. The main source of information consisted of a detailed digital terrain model, depth-to-water maps, and forest volume density. The information was supplemented with the extent of the stand, position of the landing(s), nature and culture conservation sites, and any known unavoidable crossings in the terrain (e.g., streams). Because fast solution time was a critical requirement, we developed a decomposition method based on Lagrangian relaxation. The system was evaluated in two case studies in Sweden. In the ﬁrst case, the optimization model performance was analyzed at 30 ﬁnal harvesting sites. In the second case, experienced forest company staff evaluated the primary extraction routes at 19 harvest sites in operational conditions. The results indicated that the model allowed for faster planning, shorter driving distances, and the potential to reduce negative impact on soil and water.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes a stochastic forest growth model in which the manager is able to ﬁrst thin the forest to promote better growth before harvesting. Both Wicksell single thinning-andharvesting cycle and Faustmann on-going rotation problems are considered. The Wicksell problem is analyzed by ﬁrst restricting the class of decision times to (thinning,harvesting) pairs that bound the growth away from inﬁnity and imbedding the problem in an inﬁnite-dimensional linear program on a space of triplets of measures. These measures capture the thinning and harvesting decisions along with the behavior of the growth process prior to harvest. An auxiliary linear program then leads to a nonlinear optimization problem for which an optimal value and solution are determined. The values of all the problems are be related through a set of inequalities. The solution of the nonlinear problem determines (random) thinning and harvesting times for the single thinning-andharvesting cycle which demonstrate the equality of the values of these various problems. Finally for the Wicksell problem, the unrestricted class of thinning-and-harvest times is shown to give the same value as the restricted class. The Faustmann on-going thinning-and-harvesting rotation problem is reduced to a Wicksell problem which then allows for the characterization of the value as the solution to a diﬀerent nonlinear optimization problem. The eﬀects of the opportunity to thin the forest are illustrated on a mean-reverting stochastic model.},

	abstract = {Emulating natural forest disturbance is an increasingly popular forest management paradigm that is considered a means of achieving forest sustainability. Adopting this goal requires a sound understanding of natural disturbances at scales that correspond to management policies and strategies. In boreal forest landscapes driven by periodic stand-replacing ﬁres this requires knowledge of ﬁre regime characteristics, especially their spatial and temporal variability as well as stochasticity. The major goal of this study was to demonstrate the utility of ﬁre regime simulation modeling to explore the variability of ﬁre regime characteristics, with respect to formulating and assessing forest management strategies. We conducted a modeling experiment in a boreal forest landscape of northwestern Ontario, Canada, to examine its long-term ﬁre regime in relation to forest policies on harvest size distribution. We used BFOLDS, a spatially explicit ﬁre regime model that simulates individual ﬁre events mechanistically in response to ﬁre weather, fuel patterns, and terrain. The ﬁre regimes in four large eco-regions were modeled for a 200-year period under three ﬁre-weather (cold, normal, and warm) scenarios, with replications. We found that ﬁre size distribution in all eco-regions followed power law under all weather scenarios, but their slopes and intercepts varied among eco-regions and ﬁre weather scenarios. Warming ﬁre weather increased burn rates and ﬁre numbers in all eco-regions, albeit to different degrees. Overall, the variability among eco-regions was higher than the variability among ﬁre weather scenarios, and among replicates. Comparisons of simulated ﬁre size classes with those from an 86-year long ﬁre history showed that empirical data cannot capture the variability that could be revealed by simulation modeling. We also show that ﬁre size distribution is spatially heterogeneous within eco-regions, and provide several suggestions for forest policy directions with respect to forest harvest size distributions and harvest rates, based on the variability of ﬁre regime characteristics. An assessment of present forest policies of emulating natural disturbances that guide forest harvest sizes showed that these are incongruent with simulated ﬁre size distributions under all scenarios with one exception. Overall, this study illustrates the value of scenario simulation modeling to explore and quantify the variability of forest ﬁre regime, for use in forest policies and strategies that attempt to emulate natural disturbance.

In the context of animal migration, social interactions may lead to improved decision-making, greater ability to respond to environmental cues, and the cultural transmission of optimal routes. Despite their significance, the precise nature of social interactions in migrating species remains largely unknown. Here we deploy unmanned aerial systems to collect aerial footage of caribou as they undertake their migration from Victoria Island to mainland Canada. Through a Bayesian analysis of trajectories we reveal the fine-scale interaction rules of migrating caribou and show they are attracted to one another and copy directional choices of neighbours, but do not interact through clearly defined metric or topological interaction ranges. By explicitly considering the role of social information on movement decisions we construct a map of near neighbour influence that quantifies the nature of information flow in these herds. These results will inform more realistic, mechanism-based models of migration in caribou and other social ungulates, leading to better predictions of spatial use patterns and responses to changing environmental conditions. Moreover, we anticipate that the protocol we developed here will be broadly applicable to study social behaviour in a wide range of migratory and non-migratory taxa.

	abstract = {The Lake Revelstoke caribou (LRC) are the southernmost contiguous mountain caribou population in British Columbia. Population characteristics of the LRC were examined during 1981–85, with 13 radio-collared caribou, and 1992–98, with 47 radio-collared caribou. During several late-winter censuses, sightability of marked animals was 92\% and the proportion seen was a function of the height of snow (HS). Our best estimate of the population size was 375 animals (95\% CI 337–413). Cause of death of 31 radio-collared animals included accidents (42\%), predation (29\%), and poor condition (10\%). Deaths due to avalanches (accidents) were the single leading cause at 23\%. Survival of radio-collared caribou averaged 84\% since 1992. Progesterone levels in 29 female caribou indicated that 83\% were pregnant. There was an average of 28 calves/100 adults during 1981–84, and 18 calves/100 adults during 1994–97. Survival rates of adult caribou and the ratio of calves per 100 adults indicate that the population was stable.},

	abstract = {This paper provides contextual documentation of the LANDIS model development to provide a framework for the other papers in this special issue. The LANDIS model of forest landscape disturbance and succession was developed since the early 1990s as a research and management tool that optimizes the possible landscape extent (100sha to 1000skm2), while providing mechanistic detail adequate for a broad range of potential problems. LANDIS is a raster model, and operates on landscapes mapped as cells, containing tree species age classes. Spatial processes, such as seed dispersal, and disturbances such as fire, wind, and harvesting can occur. LANDIS development benefited from the modelling and research progress of the 1960s to the1980s, including the growth of landscape ecology during the 1980s. In the past decade the model has been used by colleagues across North America, as well as in Europe and China. This has been useful to those not able to undertake the cost and effort of developing their own model, and it has provided a growing diverse set of test landscapes for the model. These areas include temperate, southern, and boreal forests of eastern North America, to montane and boreal western forests, coastal California forest and shrub systems, boreal Finnish forests, and montane forests in Switzerland and northeastern China. The LANDIS model continues to be refined and developed. Papers in this special issue document recent work. Future goals include integration within a larger land use change model, and applications to landscape and regional global change projection based on newly incorporated biomass and carbon dynamics.},

	abstract = {Understanding disturbance and recovery of forest landscapes is a challenge because of complex interactions over a range of temporal and spatial scales. Landscape simulation models offer an approach to studying such systems at broad scales. Fire can be simulated spatially using mechanistic or stochastic approaches. We describe the fire module in a spatially explicit, stochastic model of forest landscape dynamics (LANDIS) that incorporates fire, windthrow, and harvest disturbance with species-level succession. A stochastic approach is suited to forest landscape models that are designed to simulate patterns over large spatial and time domains and are not used deterministically to predict individual events. We used the model to examine how disturbance regimes and species dynamics interact across a large (500 000 ha), heterogeneous landscape in northern Wisconsin, USA, with six land types having different species environments, and fire disturbance return intervals varying from 200 to 1000 yr. The model shows that there are feedbacks over time between species, disturbance, and environment, resulting in the re-emergence of patterns that characterized the landscape before extensive alteration. Landscape equilibrium of species composition and age-class structure develops at three scales from the initial, disturbed landscape. Over 100–150 yr, fine-grained successional processes cause gradual disaggregation of the initial pattern of relatively homogenous composition and age classes. Species such as eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), largely removed from the landscape by past human activities, only slowly re-invade. Next, patterns on the various land types diverge, driven by different disturbance regimes and dominant species. Finally, aging of the landscape causes the probabilities of larger and more severe fires to increase, and a coarse-grained pattern develops from the disturbance patches. Influence of adjacent land types is shown as fires spread across land type boundaries, although modified in spread and severity. As found by others, altered landscapes are likely to retain their modified pattern for centuries, suggesting that nonequilibrium conditions between tree species and climate will persist under predicted rates of climate change. The results suggest that this modeling approach can be useful in examining species-level, broad-scale responses of heterogeneous landscapes to changes in landscape disturbance, such as modified management or land-use scenarios, or effects of global change.},

	abstract = {Habitat conversion, degradation and fragmentation, and the introduction of exotic species are among the primary factors causing the loss of biodiversity. Road density is a valuable indicator of these anthropogenic factors. Deleterious biological effects extend more than 1000 metres from roads, and road density of 0.6 km/km2 has been identified as an apparent threshold value above which natural populations of certain large vertebrates decline. Road density assessments in Nova Scotia indicate that many areas exceed this threshold. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicate relationships between road density, moose pellet distribution, and habitat suitability values. Road density has a statistically significant negative correlation with moose pellets, such that as road density increases, the probability of moose pellet presence decreases. Road density alone and road density in combination with habitat suitability index values predict the presence of moose pellets, whereas habitat suitability values alone do not. Thus, road density may be an indicator of moose habitat selection or effectiveness in mainland Nova Scotia. Biodiversity conservation activities in Nova Scotia and elsewhere could focus on discouraging further road densities above 0.6 km/km2; protecting remaining roadless and low road density areas; minimizing new road construction, especially in natural areas; decommissioning and regenerating old logging roads; increasing buffer zones between natural areas and roads; and providing road crossings for wildlife in the form of under and overpasses.La conversion, la dégradation et la fragmentation des habitats ainsi que l’introduction d’espèces exotiques figurent parmi les principaux facteurs responsables de la réduction de la biodiversité. La densité routière est un indicateur précieux de ces facteurs anthropiques. Des effets biologiques négatifs se font sentir à plus de 1 000 mètres des routes, et il semble qu’une densité routière de 0,6 km/km2 constitue un seuil au-dessus duquel les populations naturelles de certains gros vertébrés diminuent. En Nouvelle-Écosse, la densité routière dépasse ce seuil dans plusieurs régions. Des analyses de régression logistique multivariée révèlent des relations entre la densité routière, la répartition des excréments d’orignaux et les valeurs de qualité de l’habitat. Il existe une corrélation négative significative entre la densité routière et les excréments d’orignaux, l’augmentation de la densité routière réduisant la probabilité de la présence d’excréments. La densité routière seule et la densité routière combinée aux valeurs de l’indice de qualité de l’habitat permettent de prévoir la présence d’excréments d’orignaux, tandis que les valeurs de qualité de l’habitat seules ne peuvent le faire. Par conséquent, la densité routière peut être un indicateur du choix ou de l’utilité de l’habitat pour l’orignal dans la partie continentale de la Nouvelle-Écosse. Dans cette province et ailleurs, les activités de conservation de la biodiversité pourraient mettre l’accent sur le maintien de la densité routière à moins de 0,6 km/km2, sur la protection des zones sans route et à faible densité routière, sur la réduction de la construction de nouvelles routes, en particulier dans les régions naturelles, sur la mise hors-service et la restauration des vieux chemins d’exploitation forestière, sur l’augmentation des zones tampons entre les régions naturelles et les routes et sur l’aménagement de traversées routières (tunnels et viaducs) pour les animaux sauvages.},

	abstract = {Geographic modelers frequently compare maps of observed land transitions to maps of simulated land transitions to relate the patterns in reference maps to the output from a simulation model. Pixel-by-pixel analysis of raster maps at a single resolution is useful for this task at a single scale, but scientists often need to consider additional scales. This article presents methods to satisfy this need by proposing a multiple-resolution method to compare land categories in three maps: a reference map of time 1, a reference map of time 2, and a simulation map of time 2. The method generates a three-dimensional table that gives the percentage of the study area for each combination of categories at the maps’ native resolution and at several nested sets of coarser squares. The method differentiates allocation disagreement within coarse squares, allocation disagreement among coarse squares, quantity disagreement, and agreement. We illustrate the method with output from a run of the SAMBA agent-based model from 1990 to 2001 using 32-m resolution pixels for Cho Don District, Vietnam. Results show that half of the overall disagreement is attributable to allocation disagreement within squares that are 506 m × 506 m, which is about the average size of a village. Much of the remaining disagreement is misallocation of forest and shrub between the northern and southern parts of the district, which is caused by differences between the data and the simulation concerning transitions from the crop and shrub categories.},

	abstract = {Conservation scientists call for establishing additional protected areas amidst ongoing threats of expanding human development. Nevertheless, some existing protected areas are being downsized and demoted of their existing conservation protections. In 2001, the Roadless Area Conservation Rule prohibited road construction and timber harvest in 240,000 km2 of inventoried roadless areas (IRAs) located on United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service lands. IRAs represent a non-legislative protected status that is in jeopardy of conservation demotion or “degazettement,” and few national protected area assessments recognize the IRA designation. Since the rule's conception two decades ago, little research has been conducted to assess the conservation values of IRAs and the values they could add to the existing system of highly protected areas in the continental United States. To increase understanding of these conservation values, we assessed three aspects of roadless areas: (a) how wild and intact are IRA lands compared to state, national, and protected lands, (b) how do IRAs complement the size, connectedness, and representation of protected lands, and (c) how do IRAs contribute to protection of important ecosystem services (drinking water and annual carbon capture)? Through this analysis we found that many IRAs are among the most wild, undeveloped areas both in the nation and within their respective states. IRAs increase the size of—and reduce isolation between—protected areas, likely buffering them from external stressors. In some places, IRAs protect watersheds that deliver drinking water to hundreds of thousands of people. IRAs also add significantly to the total carbon captured by existing protected areas. The results of our evaluation demonstrate the potential of IRAs to contribute to the conservation value of the U.S. protected area system and to deliver important ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {Understanding how conservation of woodland caribou, an at-risk species for which large undisturbed areas are often proposed to maintain viable populations, can contribute to conservation of boreal biodiversity is an important consideration for an ecosystem warming at twice the global average and experiencing rapid resource development. We assess the focal or ‘umbrella’ value of the boreal population of woodland caribou for conservation of mammalian and avian richness (n = 432) in the boreal region of Canada by (i) evaluating co-occurrence of caribou distribution with that of boreal mammals (n = 102), birds (n = 330), at-risk mammals (n = 11) and at-risk birds (n = 47); and (ii) conducting systematic conservation planning using MARXAN software to identify minimum representative and complementary reserve networks, comprised of planning units deemed large enough (10,000 km2) for persistence of terrestrial wildlife, both at the extent of boreal caribou distribution and the entire boreal region. While boreal caribou overlap with the range of 90\% of boreal birds and mammals, area-efficient networks representative of boreal diversity focus on species-rich areas south of caribou distribution and other areas that contain relatively small-ranged species. A similar pattern occurs when the MARXAN analysis focused only on caribou distribution, i.e. representative networks are preferentially located on southern herd ranges. However, this situation differs markedly to include large areas within the distribution of caribou if anthropogenic footprint on the landscape is considered as a constraint on reserve design. Efforts to sustain boreal caribou offer considerable opportunities to conserve diversity of co-occurring mammals and birds, including areas of the relatively more disturbed caribou southern ranges that have irreplaceable value in an efficient and representative pan-boreal network of reserves. The high focal value of boreal caribou for animal diversity should be considered when making decisions and policy choices about how to best allocate conservation efforts across its extensive distribution.},

Despite calls both to protect roadless areas and to downgrade them, we know surprisingly little about the importance of IRAs as habitat for vulnerable wildlife species. We assessed the importance of IRAs—in total and individually—as habitat for wildlife species of conservation concern (SCCs) and, for context, compared their habitat value to that of other national forest lands and CONUS lands in general. We also quantified how well the protected-area system would provide habitat for wildlife SCCs if all unprotected IRAs were added to it. Of the 537 wildlife SCCs in CONUS, 308 species (57\%) have at least some suitable habitat in one or more IRAs. The median IRA contains suitable habitat for 10 wildlife SCCs, with a maximum of 62 wildlife SCCs. Despite their geographic and elevational clustering and predominance of a single biome type, IRAs provide a larger proportion of suitable habitat for multiple wildlife SCCs than non-IRA CONUS lands. The median number of wildlife SCCs’ suitable habitat per 900-m2 pixel is also slightly higher in IRAs than in most national forest wilderness areas, national monuments, and other currently protected areas. If all IRAs were added to the protected-area system in CONUS, there would be a substantial decrease (−38) in the number of wildlife SCCs that are currently considered “poorly represented” in protected areas. In this study we provide quantitative information about the importance of IRAs as habitat for vulnerable wildlife species so that stakeholders, agency staff, and lawmakers can make informed choices about where to invest limited resources for conservation.},

	abstract = {Management of wildlife often relies upon understanding mechanisms linking anthropogenic disturbance to population declines. The most-cited mechanism by which disturbance threatens boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) is the exacerbation of apparent competition via increases in early successional forage, and subsequent changes in the densities and distributions of other prey species and gray wolves (Canis lupus). An alternative mechanism is the direct alteration of wolf distribution via positive responses by wolves to anthropogenic features. We conducted a mechanistic evaluation of hypotheses explaining human-mediated increases in boreal caribou mortality across northeast British Columbia. We evaluated support for (i) numeric apparent competition (increased prey densities) by evaluating relationships between disturbances, moose (Alces alces) density, and caribou survival. To evaluate (ii) spatial apparent competition (altered prey distribution) and (iii) wolf spatial responses (altered wolf distribution independent of prey), we modeled the relationships between disturbances and indices of caribou-moose and caribou-wolf co-occurrence and then examined predation risk for caribou as a function of co-occurrence. We did not detect any relationships between anthropogenic disturbances, moose density, and caribou survival. Although caribou-moose co-occurrence increased predation risk, we observed both positive and negative relationships between disturbances and caribou-moose co-occurrence. In contrast, caribou-wolf co-occurrence increased predation risk and was positively correlated with anthropogenic linear features. Contrary to other boreal caribou populations, our analyses demonstrate stronger support for the direct effects of anthropogenic linear features on caribou-wolf spatial overlap, leading to greater risk for caribou. Our research highlights the need for region-specific management actions to conserve and recover widely distributed species.},

	abstract = {Space-use behaviour reflects trade-offs in meeting ecological needs and can have consequences for individual survival and population demographics. The mechanisms underlying space use can be understood by simultaneously evaluating habitat selection and movement patterns, and fine-resolution locational data are increasing our ability to do so. We use high-resolution location data and an integrated step-selection analysis to evaluate caribou, moose, bear, and wolf habitat selection and movement behaviour in response to anthropogenic habitat modification, though caribou data were limited. Space-use response to anthropogenic linear features (LFs) by predators and prey is hypothesized to increase predator hunting efficiency and is thus believed to be a leading factor in woodland caribou declines in western Canada. We found that all species moved faster while on LFs. Wolves and bears were also attracted towards LFs, whereas prey species avoided them. Predators and prey responded less strongly and consistently to natural features such as streams, rivers and lakeshores. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that LFs facilitate predator movement and increase hunting efficiency, while prey perceive such features as risky. Understanding the behavioural mechanisms underlying space-use patterns is important in understanding how future land-use may impact predator–prey interactions. Explicitly linking behaviour to fitness and demography will be important to fully understand the implications of management strategies.},

This growth also entails a high toll for biodiversity, with several well-documented negative impacts on different species. However, there is still a great lack of knowledge about the effects of roads on the persistence of wildlife populations. Here, we aimed to summarize our current knowledge on this topic, based on systematic reviews. We found that only a small proportion of studies (8\%) focused on the effects of roads on population persistence. Most of these studies were about large mammals and were performed in high-income countries. Furthermore, these works studied only 2\% of those species identified by the IUCN Red List as threatened by roads. Overall, our results show that we are far from understanding how roads affect the long-term viability of wildlife populations inhabiting road-effect zones. Addressing this challenge will require modifying our conceptual perspective, from short-term to long-term studies, from single road sections to focusing the landscape scale, and strive to obtain empirical data to support sound analyses to assess how road impacts affect the survival of wildlife populations, namely with information required to perform approaches such as population viability analyses. We highlight some key studies from our reviews that have addressed this global conservation concern with population-oriented approaches.},

	abstract = {A central assumption underlying the study of habitat selection is that selected habitats confer enhanced fitness. Unfortunately, this assumption is rarely tested, and in some systems, gradients of predation risk may more accurately characterize spatial variation in vital rates than gradients described by habitat selection studies. Here, we separately measured spatial patterns of both resource selection and predation risk and tested their relationships with a key demographic trait, adult female survival, for a threatened ungulate, woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou Gmelin). We also evaluated whether exposure to gradients in both predation risk and resource selection value was manifested temporally through instantaneous or seasonal effects on survival outcomes. We used Cox proportional hazards spatial survival modelling to assess the relative support for 5 selection- and risk-based definitions of habitat quality, as quantified by woodland caribou adult female survival. These hypotheses included scenarios in which selection ideally mirrored survival, risk entirely drove survival, non-ideal selection correlated with survival but with additive risk effects, an ecological trap with maladaptive selection and a non-spatial effect of annual variation in weather. Indeed, we found positive relationships between the predicted values of a resource selection function (RSF) and survival, yet subsequently incorporating an additional negative effect of predation risk greatly improved models further. This revealed a positive, but non-ideal relationship between selection and survival. Gradients in these covariates were also shown to affect individual survival probability at multiple temporal scales. Exposure to increased predation risk had a relatively instantaneous effect on survival outcomes, whereas variation in habitat suitability predicted by an RSF had both instantaneous and longer-term seasonal effects on survival. Predation risk was an additive source of hazard beyond that detected through selection alone, and woodland caribou selection thus was shown to be non-ideal. Furthermore, by combining spatial adult female survival models with herd-specific estimates of recruitment in matrix population models, we estimated a spatially explicit landscape of population growth predictions for this endangered species.},

But to effectively inform environmental decision making, forecasts should not only be reliable, but should also be designed to address the needs of decision makers with their assumptions, uncertainties, and results clearly communicated. To help researchers better integrate forecasting into decision making, we outline ten practical guidelines to help navigate the interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of forecasting in social–ecological systems. Some guidelines focus on improving forecasting skills, including how to build better models, account for uncertainties and use technologies to improve their utility, while others are developed to facilitate the integration of forecasts with decision making, including how to form effective partnerships and how to design forecasts relevant to the specific decision being addressed. We hope these guidelines help researchers make forecasts more accurate, precise, transparent, and most pressingly, useful for informing environmental decisions.},

	abstract = {Habitat changes due to human exploitation of natural resources impact ecosystems worldwide, notably by causing pronounced changes in abiotic and biotic conditions, which modify biological diversity at the taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional levels. In forest ecosystems, logging is the main human disturbance impacting biodiversity. The interplay between forest harvesting and biodiversity varies, however, with climate change through complex relationships that remain poorly documented. Our aim was to study the expected long-term variations in the assemblage of bird and beetle communities following modifications in forest management under different climate change scenarios. We develop empirical models predicting the distribution of 104 animal species in eastern Canadian boreal forest over the next century. We predict that forest harvesting will alter the diversity of both taxa by increasing assemblage dissimilarity under all the studied climate scenarios, mainly due to species turnover. Regionally, an overall increase in occupancy probability is projected for bird species, whereas a decrease is predicted for beetles, a variation that could reflect differences in ecological traits between taxa. Our results further predict a decrease in the number of species that increase their occupancy after harvest under the most severe climatic scenario for both taxa. We anticipate that under severe climate change, increasing forest disturbance will modify species habitat associated with both young and old habitats.},

We synthesized the modelling literature on forest resilience, summarizing common models and applications in resilience research, and scrutinizing the implementation of important resilience mechanisms in these models. Models applied to assess resilience are highly diverse, and our goal was to assess how well they account for important resilience mechanisms identified in experimental and empirical research. Location Global. Time period 1994 to 2019. Major taxa studied Trees. Methods We reviewed the forest resilience literature using online databases, selecting 119 simulation modelling studies for further analysis. We identified a set of resilience mechanisms from the general resilience literature and analysed models for their representation of these mechanisms. Analyses were grouped by investigated drivers (resilience to what) and responses (resilience of what), as well as by the type of model being used. Results Models used to study forest resilience varied widely, from analytical approaches to complex landscape simulators. The most commonly addressed questions were associated with resilience of forest cover to fire. Important resilience mechanisms pertaining to regeneration, soil processes, and disturbance legacies were explicitly simulated in only 34 to 46\% of the model applications. Main conclusions We found a large gap between processes identified as underpinning forest resilience in the theoretical and empirical literature, and those represented in models used to assess forest resilience. Contemporary forest models developed for other goals may be poorly suited for studying forest resilience during an era of accelerating change. Our results highlight the need for a new wave of model development to enhance understanding of and management for resilient forests.},

	abstract = {Many boreal populations of woodland caribou in Canada are declining, mainly due to the prevalence of anthropogenic disturbances which alter predator-prey dynamics. Climate change is expected to exert an additional negative influence on caribou populations in coming decades, but it is unclear whether or how human activities and climate change will interact to influence habitat suitability for caribou, and how important these agents of change will be relative to each other. In this study, we used the LANDIS-II forest landscape model to forecast boreal caribou habitat suitability across its distribution within the harvestable boreal forest in Québec for the period 2020–2100, under three increasing anthropogenic radiative forcing scenarios (baseline, Representative Concentration Pathways [RCP] 4.5 and 8.5), and two contrasting harvest scenarios (with and without harvest). Our simulations revealed that harvesting was the dominant agent explaining future variations in caribou habitat suitability, although climate change also decreased habitat suitability, especially under RCP 8.5. Climate-induced decreases in habitat suitability mostly originated from increases in wildfires that burned mature conifer-dominated forests, i.e., high-quality habitat for caribou. Habitat suitability by 2100 was also predicted to vary spatially, with the northeastern and northwestern parts of the study area supporting better caribou habitat conditions regardless of scenarios. We show that reducing harvest activities in areas where habitat suitability is currently high could help maintain high-quality caribou habitat even under the most intense climate change scenario. Our results also suggest that highly-disturbed regions which currently provide low-quality habitat may not improve in the future unless active habitat restoration is performed. Our study helps disentangle the potential future effects of forest management and climate change as threats to caribou habitat, emphasizing the urgency of reconciling forest management with the conservation of this species at risk in Canada.},

Here, we summarize conceptual advances and empirical approaches to disturbance interaction investigation, and used those insights to evaluate and categorize 146 landscape modeling studies emerging from a systematic review of the literature published since 2010. Recent conceptual advances include formal disaggregation of disturbances into their constituent components, embedding disturbance processes into system dynamics, and clarifying terminology for interaction factors, types, and ecosystem responses. Empirical studies investigating disturbance interactions now span a wide range of approaches, including (most recently) advanced statistical methods applied to an expanding set of spatial and temporal datasets. Concurrent development in spatially-explicit landscape models, informed by these empirical insights, integrate the interactions among natural and anthropogenic disturbances by coupling these processes to account for disturbance stochasticity, disturbance within and across scales, and non-linear landscape responses to climate change. Still, trade-offs between model elegance and complexity remain. We developed an index for the degree of process integration (i.e., balance of static vs. dynamic components) within a given disturbance agent and applied it to the studies from our systematic review. Contemporary model applications in this line of research have applied a wide range process integration, depending on the specific question, but also limited in part by data and knowledge. Non-linear “threshold” behavior and cross-scaled interactions remain a frontier in temperate, boreal, and alpine regions of North America and Europe, while even simplistic studies are lacking from other regions of the globe (e.g., subtropical and tropical biomes). Understanding and planning for uncertainty in system behavior—including disturbance interactions—is paramount at a time of accelerated anthropogenic change. While progress in landscape modeling studies in this area is evident, work remains to increase model transparency and confidence, especially for understudied regions and processes. Moving forward, a multi-dimensional approach is recommended to address the uncertainties of complex human-ecological dynamics.},

	abstract = {The introduction of renewable energy (RE) is essential for building a sustainable society. However, RE can cause conflicts between energy production and biodiversity conservation. This study conducted a scenario analysis to evaluate potential conflicts in the nexuses between energy and biodiversity for the Bekambeushi River watershed located in northeastern Japan. The increasing rate of pastureland abandonment resulting from a declining farmer population is a source of great uncertainty in this area. Two alternative sources of RE were selected to utilize these abandoned pasturelands, each taking a unique approach to meet targets stipulated by regional energy plans, thereby producing different ecological consequences at the landscape scale. Thirty-one RE introduction options were simulated, comprising a range of pastureland abandonment expansion speeds and ratios of solar photovoltaic (PV) plant installation to biomass energy use. These were superimposed using two IPCC representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, 2.6 and 8.5, resulting in 62 scenarios that were summarized as three groups based on the RE supply–demand balance and the ecological impacts. The LANDIS-II model was used to simulate these scenarios from 2016 to 2100. The results indicate that both the rate of pastureland abandonment and the ratio of the two RE sources had a large impact on changes in tree species diversity and the habitat suitability of raptors. Abandoned pastureland converted to tree biomass energy production shifted to pioneer species-dominated forest. The plant species composition of transitional forests varied between the climate scenarios. The higher temperature of the RCP 8.5 scenario toward 2100 prevented the establishment of Betula platyphylla and altered tree species diversity and the habitat suitability of Ketupa blakistoni blakistoni. Biomass energy utilization produced less energy than the demand but increased the three ecological indicators. Solar PV systems provided more energy than the regional demand, but the tree diversity and habitat suitability indices for two raptors declined. However, an appropriate mixture of the two RE sources satisfied the regional energy demand and maintained ecological conditions. Our results suggest that land–energy planning should consider energy–biodiversity nexuses to strike a balance between decarbonization and biodiversity conservation.},

Our hypotheses were: (1) species associated with older mixed-wood stands would decline more if harvest was shifted away from areas used by caribou to areas with more mixed-wood; and (2) species associated with older forests would be more negatively affected by the combined effects of harvest, fire, and non-forestry footprint than by harvest alone. We used vegetation data from two harvest scenarios produced in Patchworks as inputs for density models of 20 boreal forest songbird and woodpecker species in Alberta. We projected abundance of these species over 50 years under: 1) two scenarios created in Patchworks, without fire but with and without deferral of timber harvest within a caribou conservation zone on lands tenured to Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries Inc.; (2) a scenario with fire but no human footprint; and (3) five scenarios in ALCES Online, in which habitat was affected by Patchworks harvest locations, fire (1–2 × current rate), and energy sector development (present or absent; with or without seismic line reclamation to improve caribou habitat). In the Patchworks scenarios, we found similar projected numbers of each bird species over time, whether harvest deferral occurred or not. Both harvest plans increased habitat and numbers for most species associated with older forests over 50 years, while most species associated with younger forests declined in both harvest plans, because average projected forest age increased over 50 years. Fire and other footprint generally reduced relative amount of habitat for species associated with older forests, which still increased over time, while other species responded positively or less negatively to fire. Seismic restoration created habitat for three-quarters of species that responded negatively to energy sector development over 50 years. As projections depended on whether just harvest, fire or all footprints were analyzed, multiple human impacts over time beyond harvest should be considered in conservation and land use planning based on long-term predictions about wildlife in anthropogenic landscapes.},

	abstract = {The natural and old-growth forests and their associated biodiversity continues to fade worldwide due to anthropogenic impact in various forms. The boreal forests in Fennoscandia have been subject to intensive clearfelling forestry since the middle of twentieth century. As a result, only a fraction of forests with long temporal continuity remains at the landscape level. In Sweden, some of these primary forests have been formally protected, whereas other forests with known high conservation values are not. Collectively, both protected and not protected known valuable primary forests are included in a nationally delineated network of high conservation value forests (HCVF). In addition to HCVF, older forests that have not been clearfelled since the mid-1900s, i.e., “proxy continuity forests,” have recently been mapped across the entire boreal biome in Sweden. In this paper, we analyze how these proxy continuity forests may strengthen the HCVF network from a green infrastructure perspective. First, we evaluate the spatial overlap between proxy continuity forests and HCVF. Second, we perform a large-scale connectivity analysis, in which we show that adding proxy continuity forests located outside HCVF strongly increases the structural connectivity of the network of protected forests. Finally, by assessing habitat suitability for virtual species specialized in pine, spruce, and broadleaf forests, we find large regional differences in the ability to secure habitat and thereby functional green infrastructure by considering currently unprotected primary forest. We show that, by adding those forests to the network, the area of habitat for low-demanding species dependent on spruce or pine forests can be largely increased. For high-demanding species, additional habitat restoration in the landscape matrix is needed. By contrast, even counting all valuable broadleaf forests available is not enough to provide a suitable habitat for their associated species, which indicates a large need for landscape-scale habitat restoration initiatives, in particular, for broadleaf forests.},

	abstract = {To halt ongoing loss in biodiversity, there is a need for landscape-level management recommendations that address cumulative impacts of anthropogenic and natural disturbances on wildlife habitat. We examined the cumulative effects of logging, roads, land-use change, fire, and bark beetle outbreaks on future habitat for olive-sided flycatcher (Contopus cooperi), a steeply declining aerial insectivorous songbird, in Canada’s western boreal forest. To predict the occurrence of olive-sided flycatcher we developed a suite of habitat suitability models using point count surveys (1997–2011) spatially- and temporally-matched with forest inventory data. Flycatcher occurrence was positively associated with small (∼10 ha) 10- to 20-year-old clearcuts, and with 10–100\% tree mortality due to mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks, but we found no association with roads or distance to water. We used the parameter estimates from the best-fit habitat suitability models to inform spatially explicit state-and-transition simulation models to project change in habitat availability from 2020 to 2050 under six alternative scenarios (three management × two fire alternatives). The simulation models projected that the cumulative effects of land use conversion, forest harvesting, and fire will reduce the area of olive-sided flycatcher habitat by 16–18\% under Business As Usual management scenarios and by 11–13\% under scenarios that include protection of 30\% of the land base. Scenarios limiting the size of all clearcuts to ≤10 ha resulted in a median habitat loss of 4–6\%, but projections were highly variable. Under all three management alternatives, a 50\% increase in fire frequency (expected due to climate change) exacerbated habitat loss. The projected losses of habitat in western boreal forest, even with an increase in protected areas, imply that reversing the ongoing population declines of olive-sided flycatcher and other migratory birds will require attention to forest management beyond protected areas. Further work should examine the effects of multiple stressors on the demographic mechanisms driving change in aerial insectivore populations, including stressors on the wintering grounds in South America, and should aim to adapt the design of protected areas and forest management policies to projected climate-driven increases in the size and frequency of wildfires.},

	abstract = {The decline of many woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations is thought to be linked with habitat disturbances resulting from industrial development, including timber harvesting and its network of haul roads. Defining a disturbance-abundance relationship offers a tool to assess and potentially manage for the influence of disturbance on caribou abundance. Defining this relationship is challenged by limited historical land use and abundance data, the choice of a disturbance measure, and variability in the relationship between subpopulations and across core versus matrix habitat. For 12 subpopulations of woodland caribou within the southern mountain population, we linked longitudinal caribou abundance data with historical forestry disturbances simulated from forest harvest data. We compared disturbance measures estimating the proportion of forested area commercially harvested with even-aged, regeneration treatments (cutblocks) and converted to roads for transporting timber within subpopulation-specific core and matrix habitats as predictors of caribou abundance. Non-linear mixed models provided evidence that disturbances in matrix habitats negatively influenced caribou abundance, with the effects in core habitat being variable between subpopulations. Of the disturbance types evaluated, the best predictors included roads buffered by 50 m (R50), cutblocks ≤80 years old, and the cumulation of cutblocks ≤80 years old plus roads buffered by 50 m. The top-ranked model was composed of R50 present in core and in matrix habitats. This model predicted a 42\% (95\% CI = 33–51\%) reduction in caribou abundance for every 1\% increase in matrix R50 (holding core R50 constant). Given the lack of pre-forestry abundance data, we failed to directly derive critical disturbance thresholds; however, our models could be used to estimate subpopulation-specific habitat-disturbance thresholds necessary to achieve abundance targets. We recommend that in addition to existing protections of core habitat, few if any new roads should be built in core habitat, and that timber harvest in matrix habitat should be designed to minimize the establishment of associated roads.},

Disturbance and seed dispersal are landscape-scale phenomena and are spatially linked across the landscape. Ecosystem processes (e.g., growth and decomposition) have high annual and inter-specific variation and are generally quantified at the scale of a forest stand. To link these widely scaled processes, we used biomass (living and dead) as an integrating variable that provides feedbacks between disturbance and ecosystem processes and feedbacks among multiple disturbances. We integrated a simple model of biomass growth, mortality, and decay into LANDIS, a spatially dynamic landscape simulation model. The new biomass module was statically linked to PnET-II, a generalized ecosystem process model. The combined model simulates disturbances (fire, wind, harvesting), dispersal, forest biomass growth and mortality, and inter- and intra-specific competition. We used the model to quantify how fire and windthrow alter forest succession, living biomass and dead biomass across an artificial landscape representative of northern Wisconsin, USA.

Hence, no forest road simulation tool properly exists to assist forest landscape ecology and management research. Here, we present the Forest Roads Simulation (FRS) extension for the LANDIS-II model—a spatially explicit landscape simulation model of forest succession and disturbances. The FRS extension simulates forest road networks via a least-cost path algorithm accounting for landscape structure, decision inputs, and forest road types. We demonstrate the accuracy with which the FRS extension reproduces several key characteristics of existing road networks in two managed regions in Quebec, Canada: road density, road position, and fragmentation of the landscape. The FRS extension is easy to parameterize, proposing many options for researchers to simulate forest road networks at a strategic level in managed landscapes. It can tackle new research questions investigating the effects of forest roads within management strategies, such as the cost of road construction and habitat fragmentation, across large management units and long planning horizons.},

We used simulations of forest dynamics and movements of interacting species, parameterized by empirical observations, to predict the outcomes of global change on a large-mammal food web in the boreal forest. We demonstrate that climate- and land-use-induced changes in forest landscapes exacerbate asymmetrical apparent competition between moose and threatened caribou populations through wolf predation. Although increased prey mortalities came from both behavioral and numerical responses, indirect effects from numerical responses had an overwhelming effect. The increase in caribou mortalities was exacerbated by the cumulating effects of land use over the short term and climate change impacts over the long term, with higher impact of land use. Indirect trophic interactions will be key to understanding community dynamics under global change.},

	abstract = {The location and operation of harvest machinery, along with the design and construction of access roads, are important problems faced by forestry planners, making up about 55\% of total production costs. One of the main challenges consists of finding a design that will minimize the cost of installation and operation of harvest machinery, road construction, and timber transport, while complying with the technical restrictions that apply to the operation of harvesting equipment and road construction. We can model the network design problem as a mixed-integer linear programming problem. This model is fed with cartographic information, provided by a geographic information system (GIS), along with technical and economic parameters determined by the planner. We developed a specialized heuristic for the problem to obtain solutions that enable harvesting economically profitable volumes at a low cost. This methodology was programmed into a computer system known as PLANEX and is being applied in nine forestry companies that report important benefits from its use.},

	abstract = {The growing human footprint has placed unprecedented stressors on ecosystems in recent decades resulting in losses of biodiversity and ecosystem function around the world. Roads are influential through their direct footprint and facilitating human access; however, their influence can be mitigated. Here, we review the scientific literature on the relationship between grizzly bears (Ursus arctos), human motorized access, and the efficacy of motorized access control as a tool to benefit grizzly bear conservation in western Canada. We found that motorized access affected grizzly bears at the individual and population levels through effects on bears' habitat use, home range selection, movements, population fragmentation, survival, and reproductive rates that ultimately were reflected in population density, trend, and conservation status. Motorized access management was effective in mitigating these effects. Our review of the scientific literature suggests that industrial road management would be a useful tool if (a) roads exist in high-quality grizzly bear habitats with population-energy-rich food resources; (b) open road densities exceed 0.6 km/km2; (c) less than at least 60\% of the unit's area is {\textgreater}500 m from an open road in patch sizes of ≥10 km2. Motorized access management would be most beneficial in threatened populations, in areas where roads occur in the highest quality habitats, within and adjacent to identified linkage areas between population units, and in areas that are expected to exceed motorized route thresholds as a result of resource extraction activities. Evidence suggests benefits of motorized access management are more likely to be realized if habitat quality is integrated and is best if managed at scales that optimize the benefit of distribution, survival, reproduction, and density of female grizzly bears. We encourage land use managers developing access rules to consider a wider spectrum of biodiversity and overall habitat conservation, and suggest landscape road targets that will benefit bear conservation.},

	abstract = {Road networks and human density are major factors contributing to habitat fragmentation and loss, isolation of wildlife populations, and reduced genetic diversity. Terrestrial mammals are particularly sensitive to road networks and encroachment by human populations. However, there are limited assessments of the impacts of road networks and human density on population-specific nuclear genetic diversity, and it remains unclear how these impacts are modulated by life-history traits. Using generalized linear mixed models and microsatellite data from 1444 North American terrestrial mammal populations, we show that taxa with large home range sizes, dense populations, and large body sizes had reduced nuclear genetic diversity with increasing road impacts and human density, but the overall influence of life-history traits was generally weak. Instead, we observed a high degree of genus-specific variation in genetic responses to road impacts and human density. Human density negatively affected allelic diversity or heterozygosity more than road networks (13 vs. 5–7 of 25 assessed genera, respectively); increased road networks and human density also positively affected allelic diversity and heterozygosity in 15 and 6–9 genera, respectively. Large-bodied, human-averse species were generally more negatively impacted than small, urban-adapted species. Genus-specific responses to habitat fragmentation by ongoing road development and human encroachment likely depend on the specific capability to (i) navigate roads as either barriers or movement corridors, and (ii) exploit resource-rich urban environments. The nonuniform genetic response to roads and human density highlights the need to implement efforts to mitigate the risk of vehicular collisions, while also facilitating gene flow between populations of particularly vulnerable taxa.},

	abstract = {Diverse perspectives in the theory and practice of restoration ecology create a productive space to continuously improve outcomes for people and biodiversity. The practical side of restoration ecology often focuses on the recovery of ecosystem structure—the habitat and organisms that create ecological communities. This structural approach has led to many successes, but falls short when it comes to accommodating both complex ecological interactions and a sustainable role for people as reciprocal agents in restoration practice. Process-based restoration offers a complementary approach to this structural perspective. Just as structural restoration “balances a ledger” of facilitated and suppressed species based on their perceived value and role in meeting restoration goals, process-based restoration focuses on suppressing weedy interactions and enhancing desired interactions. At least four features characterize process-based restoration—including emphasis on the intrinsic and utilitarian values of: (1) the regenerating processes of natural disturbance; (2) functional, indirect, and trait-mediated interactions; (3) selective connectivity to titrate the amount and types of ecological flows desired for recovery goals; and (4) an inclusive human connection with nature. These features work in concert, such as renewing the role of forest burning by Indigenous people to facilitate growth of forage plants that bolster populations of harvestable animals. With restoration becoming an increasingly vital and internationally recognized field in the coming century, a more effective and inclusive approach will be needed to conserve biodiversity and the cultures that depend on it.},

Road-free areas are decreasing globally, making accurate estimation of their location and size of great importance. Identification of such regions requires accurate data, but substantial variability exists in road network datasets created and maintained at different spatial scales. We compared estimates of road length, density, and roadless areas across Canada, which contains a high proportion of the world's remaining undisturbed and road-free areas. Global- and national-scale datasets included, on average, only 11\%–14\% of roads represented in regional-scale data or volunteered geographic information (VGI), with the most pronounced differences in less-developed areas. Regional-scale datasets, with the lowest estimates of amount of roadless area and smallest mean roadless patch size, are likely the most complete road datasets but are not available for all jurisdictions, limiting their national-scale utility. VGI provides a national-scale alternative but still lacks many low-use roads. Available global and national datasets have insufficient information for accurate assessments of roadless areas in Canada, which will require detailed, consistent subnational datasets assembled and maintained by each province and territory in a coordinated fashion to achieve national coverage.},

	abstract = {Governments around the world have acknowledged that urgent action is needed to conserve and restore ecological connectivity to help reverse the decline of biodiversity. In this study we tested the hypothesis that functional connectivity for multiple species can be estimated across Canada using a single, upstream connectivity model. We developed a movement cost layer with cost values assigned using expert opinion to anthropogenic land cover features and natural features based on their known and assumed effects on the movement of terrestrial, non-volant fauna. We used Circuitscape to conduct an omnidirectional connectivity analysis for terrestrial landscapes, in which the potential contribution of all landscape elements to connectivity were considered and where source and destination nodes were independent of land tenure. Our resulting map of mean current density provided a seamless estimate of movement probability at a 300 m resolution across Canada. We tested predictions in our map using a variety of independently collected wildlife data. We found that GPS data for individual caribou, wolves, moose, and elk that traveled longer distances in western Canada were all significantly correlated with areas of high current densities. The frequency of moose roadkill in New Brunswick was also positively associated with current density, but our map was not able to predict areas of high road mortality for herpetofauna in southern Ontario. The results demonstrate that an upstream modelling approach can be used to characterize functional connectivity for multiple species across a large study area. Our national connectivity map can help governments in Canada prioritize land management decisions to conserve and restore connectivity at both national and regional scales.},

We simulated pre-industrial forest fire regimes in order to establish base-line conditions for future management. Differing model time steps substantially altered our estimates of pre-industrial forest conditions.

This problem is of economical and environmental relevance in the domain of forestry. In this study, the problem is expressed as a P-forest problem in a graph. It consists of determining a set of tree structures in a graph that covers a set of vertices corresponding to harvest areas. The objective is to minimize the sum of construction costs and harvesting costs. In addition to the location of roads, the P-forest problem has several relevant applications, including public transport, electricity transmission, roads, pipelines, and communication networks design. This paper presents a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) to solve this problem. The heuristic was implemented on a decision support system, and computational experiments were conducted on randomly generated and real instances to demonstrate the performance and practical efficiency of the proposed approach. A comparison with manually designed forest road networks in the real instances shows a clear advantage for the proposed method.},

We have refined the link pattern by considering up to 48 neighbouring cells and have introduced 16 directional classes per grid cell. Optimization techniques, such as shortest path, minimum spanning tree, and Steiner minimum tree algorithms, are used on the graph to derive a road network that is optimal in terms of its construction costs. These improved models have been applied to different mountainous project areas.

	abstract = {Accurate information on road location is critical for forest management and conservation strategies. Road location data supports the analysis of road accessibility and usability and is a critical information layer for forest harvest, financial planning, wildfire suppression, and protection activities. The global expanse of forests, their remoteness, and difficulty to access have necessitated the development of automatic or semi-automatic remote sensing methodologies to map roads using passive optical imagery or Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS). Conventional automatic road mapping methods are raster-based and map roads as patches of disconnected pixels. This paper addresses the limitations of raster-based automatic forest road extraction and presents a method for producing a topologically accurate vectorial road network. Our method, presented as a fully documented and open-source software tool, uses metrics derived from an ALS point cloud to produce a raster of road conductivity. From this conductivity raster, the method “drives” the roads iteratively by detecting and following road intersections. We demonstrate the method’s efficacy using a road network in Quebec, Canada, where 96\% of the roads in a binary raster, and 84\% using our probability map, are vectorized properly from an ALS point cloud with 4\% false positives. Our proposed method may significantly reduce the training requirements of machine learning techniques used to classify roads by being very robust to false positive and false negative classifications.},

	abstract = {Linear feature networks are the roads, trails, pipelines, and seismic lines developed throughout many commercial boreal forests. These linear features, while providing access for industrial, recreational, silvicultural, and fire management operations, also have environmental implications which involve both the active and non-active portions of the network. Management of the existing linear feature networks across boreal forests would lead to the optimization of maintenance and construction costs as well as the minimization of the cumulative environmental effects of the anthropogenic linear footprint. Remote sensing data and predictive modelling are valuable support tools for the multi-level management of this network by providing accurate and detailed quantitative information aiming to assess linear feature conditions (e.g., deterioration and vegetation characteristic dynamics). However, the potential of remote sensing datasets to improve knowledge of fine-scale vegetation characteristic dynamics within forest roads has not been fully explored. This study investigated the use of high-spatial resolution (1 m), airborne LiDAR, terrain, climatic, and field survey data, aiming to provide information on vegetation characteristic dynamics within forest roads by (i) developing a predictive model for the characterization of the LiDAR-CHM vegetation cover dynamic (response metric) and (ii) investigating causal factors driving the vegetation cover dynamic using LiDAR (topography: slope, TWI, hillshade, and orientation), Sentinel-2 optical imagery (NDVI), climate databases (sunlight and wind speed), and field inventory (clearing width and years post-clearing). For these purposes, we evaluated and compared the performance of ordinary least squares (OLS) and machine learning (ML) regression approaches commonly used in ecological modelling—multiple linear regression (mlr), multivariate adaptive regression splines (mars), generalized additive model (gam), k-nearest neighbors (knn), gradient boosting machines (gbm), and random forests (rf). We validated our models’ results using an error metric—root mean square error (RMSE)—and a goodness-of-fit metric—coefficient of determination (R2). The predictions were tested using stratified cross-validation and were validated against an independent dataset. Our findings revealed that the rf model showed the most accurate results (cross-validation: R2 = 0.69, RMSE = 18.69\%, validation against an independent dataset: R2 = 0.62, RMSE = 20.29\%). The most informative factors were clearing width, which had the strongest negative effect, suggesting the underlying influence of disturbance legacies, and years post-clearing, which had a positive effect on the vegetation cover dynamic. Our long-term predictions suggest that a timeframe of no less than 20 years is expected for both wide- and narrow-width roads to exhibit {\textasciitilde}50\% and {\textasciitilde}80\% vegetation cover, respectively. This study has improved our understanding of fine-scale vegetation dynamics around forest roads, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The information from the predictive model is useful for both the short- and long-term management of the existing network. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that spatially explicit models using LiDAR data are reliable tools for assessing vegetation dynamics around forest roads. It provides avenues for further research and the potential to integrate this quantitative approach with other linear feature studies. An improved knowledge of vegetation dynamic patterns on linear features can help support sustainable forest management.},

	abstract = {Most research on boreal populations of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) has been conducted in areas of high anthropogenic disturbance. However, a large portion of the species' range overlaps relatively pristine areas primarily affected by natural disturbances, such as wildfire. Climate-driven habitat change is a key concern for the conservation of boreal-dependent species, where management decisions have yet to consider knowledge from multiple ecological domains integrated into a cohesive and spatially explicit forecast of species-specific habitat and demography. We used a novel ecological forecasting framework to provide climate-sensitive projections of habitat and demography for five boreal caribou monitoring areas within the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada, over 90 years. Importantly, we quantify uncertainty around forecasted mean values. Our results suggest habitat suitability may increase in central and southwest regions of the NWT's Taiga Plains ecozone but decrease in southern and northwestern regions driven by conversion of coniferous to deciduous forests. We do not project that boreal caribou population growth rates will change despite forecasted changes to habitat suitability. Our results emphasize the importance of efforts to protect and restore northern boreal caribou habitat despite climate uncertainty while highlighting expected spatial variations that are important considerations for local people who rely on them. An ability to reproduce previous work, and critical thought when incorporating sources of uncertainty, will be important to refine forecasts, derive management decisions, and improve conservation efficacy for northern species at risk.},

	abstract = {The worldwide increase in anthropogenic disturbances imposed by the expansion of land use practices has important effects on vegetation dynamics and animal communities. The North American boreal forest is no exception to this global trend, and there are growing concerns regarding the persistence of linear anthropogenic features across Canada because of their negative impacts on wildlife and, particularly, on threatened species such as the boreal caribou. While many recent studies have investigated the state and distribution of regeneration on seismic lines in the western part of the country, few studies have characterized the natural regrowth of logging roads, the main type of anthropogenic linear features found in eastern Canada. As seismic lines and logging roads are structurally different, results from seismic line studies may not be easily generalized to logging roads. In this study, we therefore 1) assessed the influence of different characteristics on vegetation regrowth composition and 2) determined which environmental drivers may compromise natural regrowth on logging roads. We tested these questions using data collected from 56 1-km long road segments distributed in three different regions across Québec’s boreal forest (eastern Canada). We used a canonical correspondence analysis to characterize the species composition of vegetation regrowth on logging roads and used mixed regression models to assess the influence of different biotic and abiotic variables on regrowth establishment. The number of growing degree-days and the proportion of coniferous stands in the surroundings of a road segment explained most of the variation in species composition of the vegetation on roads. Regrowth composition on roads was distributed along a gradient shifting from a high number of alder stems (in the region with a higher number of degree-days) and a smaller proportion of coniferous stands (surrounding the road segment) to a higher number of coniferous stems in regions experiencing less growing degree-days where road segments were surrounded by a greater proportion of coniferous stands. Soil compaction was the most important variable impeding the establishment of vegetation on logging roads. A greater proportion of wetlands surrounding the road segment also contributed to poor regrowth. Our results underline the slow rate of passive regeneration of logging roads and the importance of road surface decommissioning, which should include tree planting, in the context of woodland caribou habitat restoration.},

	abstract = {Decades of expansion of industrial resource extraction in boreal forests have resulted in the legacy of thousands of kilometers of linear features (seismic lines, forest roads) that have fragmented several wildlife habitats. The decommissioning of anthropogenic linear features and the restoration of suitable habitat are top priorities for the recovery of several species at risk, among which, the threatened populations of boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). However, the decommissioning of linear features found in caribou range is expensive, and determining which characteristics make them more beneficial to caribou predators and competitors could assist in prioritizing those that may be most critical for boreal caribou habitat restoration. We thus aimed to determine how fine-scale forest road characteristics influence their use by gray wolf (Canis lupus), black bear (Ursus americanus), moose (Alces americanus) and caribou. We used camera traps and generalized linear mixed models to test the effect of road-scale characteristics on the use of forest roads by wolves, bears and moose while also considering larger-scale covariates. Wolves had a greater probability of using roads that were surrounded by wetlands and had a low lateral cover density. For bears, the intensity of use was lower on 20+ year-old roads when compared to 0–10-year-old roads, and higher on roads surrounded by coniferous stands. Moose intensity of use was higher on 11–20-year-old roads and lower on 30+ year-old roads, and decreased on roads surrounded by clearcuts and with a lower number of deciduous stems growing on them. We could not test for caribou use as we did not capture enough events. Nevertheless, by showing which forest roads are more used by caribou predators (wolves and bears) and its apparent competitor (moose), our study highlights the importance of considering both road-scale characteristics and the landscape context in which roads are built to prioritize the most detrimental roads to caribou conservation and guide efficient restoration efforts of its habitat.},

	abstract = {Modelling is widely used in ecology and its utility continues to increase as scientists, managers and policy-makers face pressure to effectively manage ecosystems and meet conservation goals with limited resources. As the urgency to forecast ecosystem responses to global change grows, so do the number and complexity of predictive ecological models and the value of iterative prediction, both of which demand validation and cross-model comparisons. This challenges ecologists to provide predictive models that are reusable, interoperable, transparent and able to accommodate updates to both data and algorithms. We propose a practical solution to this challenge based on the PERFICT principles (frequent Predictions and Evaluations of Reusable, Freely accessible, Interoperable models, built within Continuous workflows that are routinely Tested), using a modular and integrated framework. We present its general implementation across seven common components of ecological model applications—(i) the modelling toolkit; (ii) data acquisition and treatment; (iii) model parameterisation and calibration; (iv) obtaining predictions; (v) model validation; (vi) analysing and presenting model outputs; and (vii) testing model code—and apply it to two approaches used to predict species distributions: (1) a static statistical model, and (2) a complex spatiotemporally dynamic model. Adopting a continuous workflow enabled us to reuse our models in new study areas, update predictions with new data, and re-parameterise with different interoperable modules using freely accessible data sources, all with minimal user input. This allowed repeating predictions and automatically evaluating their quality, while centralised inputs, parameters and outputs, facilitated ensemble forecasting and tracking uncertainty. Importantly, the integrated model validation promotes a continuous evaluation of the quality of more- or less-parsimonious models, which is valuable in predictive ecological modelling. By linking all stages of an ecological modelling exercise, it is possible to overcome common challenges faced by ecological modellers, such as changing study areas, choosing between different modelling approaches, and evaluating the appropriateness of the model. This ultimately creates a more equitable and robust playing field for both modellers and end users (e.g. managers), and contributes to position predictive ecology as a central contributor to global change forecasting.},

An alternative consists in using numerical optimization techniques to find a solution to this problem, also known as the multiple target access problem (MTAP). We used six numerical methods, three of which were found in the literature, to solve the MTAP. The six methods were compared on the basis on the building cost of the road network that they create, and on the basis of the computing time. They were used to solve randomly generated MTAP and also to solve a real case-study in an Indonesian rain-forest at Bulungan. The method that yielded the lowest building cost also required the longest computing time. Its computing time is actually so long that this method cannot be used in real situations. The fastest method poorly minimized the building cost. Among the four remaining methods, two methods were faster than the two others (by a factor 1.5 and 2). One of these two faster methods also yielded the lowest building costs among the four remaining methods.},

	abstract = {For wildland firefighters, the ability to efficiently evacuate the fireline is limited by terrain, vegetation, and fire conditions. The impacts of terrain and vegetation on evacuation time to a safety zone may not be apparent when considering potential control locations either at the time of a wildfire or during pre-suppression planning. To address the need for a spatially-explicit measure of egress capacity, this paper introduces the Escape Route Index (ERI). Ranging from 0 to 1, ERI is a normalized ratio of the distance traveled within a time frame, accounting for impedance by slope and vegetation, to the optimal distance traveled in the absence of these impediments. An ERI approaching 1 indicates that terrain and vegetation conditions should have little impact on firefighter mobility while an ERI approaching 0 is representative of limited cross-country travel mobility. The directional nature of evacuation allows for the computation of four ERI metrics: (1) ERImean (average ERI in all travel directions); (2) ERImin (ERI in direction of lowest egress); (3) ERImax (ERI in direction of highest egress); and (4) ERIazimuth (azimuth of ERImax direction). We demonstrate the implementation of ERI for three different evacuation time frames (10, 20, and 30 min) on the Angeles National Forest in California, USA. A previously published, crowd-sourced relationship between slope and travel rate was used to account for terrain, while vegetation was accounted for by using land cover to adjust travel rates based on factors from the Wildland Fire Decision Support System (WFDSS). Land cover was found to have a stronger impact on ERI values than slope. We also modeled ERI values for several recent wildland firefighter entrapments to assess the degree to which landscape conditions may have contributed to these events, finding that ERI values were generally low from the crews’ evacuation starting points. We conclude that mapping ERI prior to engaging a fire could help inform overall firefighter risk for a given location and aid in identifying locations with greater egress capacity in which to focus wildland fire suppression, thus potentially reducing risk of entrapment. Continued improvements in accuracy of vegetation density mapping and increased availability of light detection and ranging (lidar) will greatly benefit future implementations of ERI.},

	abstract = {Forest roads provide access to remote wooded areas, serving as key transportation routes and contributing to human impact on the local environment. However, large animals, such as bears (Ursus sp.), moose (Alces alces), and caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), are affected by their presence. Many publicly available road layers are outdated or inaccurate, making the assessment of landscape objectives difficult. To address these gaps in road location data, we employ CubeSat Imagery from the Planet constellation to predict the occurrence of road probabilities using a SegNet Convolutional Neural Network. Our research examines the potential of a pre-trained neural network (VGG-16 trained on ImageNet) transferred to the remote sensing domain. The classification is refined through post-processing, which considers spatial misalignment and road width variability. On a withheld test subset, we achieve an overall accuracy of 99.1\%, a precision of 76.1\%, and a recall of 91.2\% (F1-Score: 83.0\%) after considering these effects. We investigate the performance with respect to canopy coverage using a spectral greenness index, topography (slope and aspect), and land cover metrics. Results found that predictions are best in flat areas, with low to medium canopy coverage, and in the forest (coniferous and deciduous) land cover classes. The results are vectorized into a drivable road network, allowing for vector-based routing and coverage analyses. Our approach digitized 14,359 km of roads in a 23,500 km2 area in British Columbia, Canada. Compared to a governmental dataset, our method missed 10,869 km but detected an additional 5774 km of roads connected to the network. Finally, we use the detected road locations to investigate road age by accessing an archive of Landsat data, allowing spatiotemporal modelling of road access to remote areas. This provides important information on the development of the road network over time and the calculation of impacts, such as cumulative effects on wildlife.},

	abstract = {Habitat change is a major driver of species distribution and persistence, but there have been few recorded extinction events for terrestrial mammals across Canada. Currently, we are observing the decline, extirpation, and perhaps extinction of several evolutionarily significant units of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), an iconic and cultural keystone species. We used an extensive set of caribou locations (5 subpopulations, 102 animals, 270,808GPS-collar locations) collected over 11years within the Central Mountain Designatable Unit to develop species distribution models that quantified avoidance by caribou of anthropogenic and natural disturbance features. Those empirical relationships allowed us to measure the loss of habitat over a 22-year period and correlate habitat change with measured population decline. The disturbance responses for caribou were complex and varied by season and subpopulation. We modelled a zone of influence for roads (1.75km), seismic and pipelines (2.5km), oil and gas features (4.25km), cutblocks (5.5km), burns (8.0km), and coal mines (3.0km). When the distribution models for each subpopulation were applied to the respective seasonal ranges, we measured a maximum loss in high-quality habitat of 65.9\%. The reduction in habitat was strongly correlated with the annual multiplicative growth rate of 5 subpopulations of caribou. At current rates of habitat loss and population decline, these caribou, a significant component of Canada’s biodiversity, are unlikely to persist. Although the factors leading to extinction are complex, the cumulative impacts of industrial development are a correlative if not causative factor.},

	abstract = {We tested performance of 3 aspects of an elk (Cervus elaphus)-road density model that has been used extensively throughout western North America but has not been sufficiently validated. First, we tested the hypothesis that elk selection of habitats increases with increasing distance away from open roads. This forms the empirical basis for the model. Second, we compared the model's predictions of relative elk habitat selection, or habitat effectiveness (HE), with observed values at varying levels of road density. And third, we examined the potentially confounding effects of different spatial patterns of roads on model predictions. We conducted our study during spring and summer, 1993-95, at the Starkey Experimental Forest and Range (Starkey), northeast Oregon. Selection ratios were calculated using {\textgreater}100,000 recorded locations of 89 radiocollared female elk, with locations mapped in relation to 0.1-km-wide distance bands away from open roads. Selection ratios increased with increasing distance from open roads, and varied between seasons, but not among years or individual animals. Linear regression models, using distance to open roads as a predictor, accounted for significant variation in selection ratios during spring and summer. Model predictions of HE, as measured by number of elk locations, corresponded only weakly, however, with observed values of HE. The contradictory results of these 2 analyses may be explained in part by our simulation results, which showed that potential reductions in elk HE vary strongly with the spatial pattern of roads, which is not measured by the elk-road density model. Our results suggest that (1) management of roads and related human activities during spring and summer should remain an important consideration for modeling and managing the elk resource; and (2) a spatially explicit road component is needed for elk habitat models.},
