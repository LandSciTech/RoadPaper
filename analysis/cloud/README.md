# Running analysis in the cloud

Setting up a pool with many VMs to run each method on a separate node so there are no possible memory leaks etc.

Steps:

1) Step through the setup_azure.sh script interactively. You will need to edit the total number of tasks and pool name as needed. 
2) Tasks will run and when complete the results should be copied to the Azure storage container. This should take ~X time.
